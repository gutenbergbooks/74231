INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p>
Three thousand years ago the world was still
young.  The western continent was a huge wilderness,
and the greater part of Europe was inhabited
by savage and wandering tribes.  Only a few
nations at the eastern end of the Mediterranean
and in the neighbouring parts of Asia had learned
to dwell in cities, to use a written language, to
make laws for themselves, and to live in a more
orderly fashion.  Of these nations the most brilliant
was that of the Greeks, who were destined
in war, in learning, in government, and in the arts,
to play a great part in the world, and to be the
real founders of our modern civilization.  While
they were still a rude people, they had noble ideals
of beauty and bravery, of duty and justice.  Even
before they had a written language, their singers
had made songs about their heroes and their great
deeds; and later these songs, which fathers had
taught to children, and these children to their
children, were brought together into two long and
wonderful poems, which have ever since been the
delight of the world, the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Iliad</i> is the story of the siege of Ilium, or
Troy, on the western coast of Asia Minor.  Paris,
son of the king of Troy, had enticed Helen, the
most beautiful of Grecian women, and the wife of
a Grecian king, to leave her husband's home with
him; and the kings and princes of the Greeks had
gathered an army and a fleet and sailed across
the Ægean Sea to rescue her.  For ten years they
strove to capture the city.  According to the
fine old legends, the gods themselves took a part
in the war, some siding with the Greeks, and
some with the Trojans.  It was finally through
Ulysses, a famous Greek warrior, brave and fierce
as well as wise and crafty, that the Greeks captured
the city.
</p>

<p>
The second poem, the <i>Odyssey</i>, tells what befell
Ulysses, or Odysseus, as the Greeks called him,
on his homeward way.  Sailing from Troy with
his little fleet of ships, which were so small that
they used oars as well as sails, he was destined to
wander for ten years longer before he could return
to his rocky island of Ithaca, on the west shore of
Greece, and to his faithful wife, Penelope.
</p>

<p>
He had marvellous adventures, for the gods who
had opposed the Greeks at Troy had plotted to
bring him ill-fortune.  Just as his ships were
safely rounding the southern cape of Greece, a
fierce storm took them out of their course and bore
them to many strange lands&mdash;lands of giants,
man-eating monsters, and wondrous enchantments
of which you will delight to read.  Through countless
perils the resolute wanderer forced his way,
losing ship after ship from his little fleet, and
companion after companion from his own band, until
he reached home friendless and alone, and found
his palace, his property, and his family all in the
power of a band of greedy princes.  These he
overcame by his cunning and his strength, and his long
trials were ended.
</p>

<p>
As you read these ancient tales, you must forget
what knowledge you have of the world, and think
of it as the Greeks did. It was only a little part
of the world that they knew at all,&mdash;the eastern
end of the Mediterranean,&mdash;but even that seemed
to them a great and marvellous region.  Beyond
its borders were strange and mysterious lands, in
which wonders of all kinds were found, and round
all ran the great world-river, the encircling stream
of Ocean.
</p>

<p>
In the mountains of Olympus, to the northward,
lived the gods.  There was Zeus, greatest of all,
the god of thunder and the wide heavens; Hera,
his wife; Apollo, the archer god; Athene, the
wise and clever goddess; Poseidon, who ruled the
sea; Aphrodite, the goddess of love; Hephæstus,
the cunning workman; Ares, the god of war;
Hermes, the swift messenger; and others still,
whom you will learn to know as you read.  All
these were worshipped by men with prayer and
sacrifice; and, as in the early legends of many
races, the gods often took the shape of men and
women; they had their favourites and those whom
they hated; and they ruled the fate of mortals as
they chose.
</p>

<p>
If you let yourselves be beguiled into this old,
simple way of regarding earth and heaven, you
will not only love these ancient tales yourself, but
you will see why, for century after century, they
have been the longest loved and the best loved of
all tales&mdash;beloved by old and young, by men and
women and children.  For they are hero-tales,&mdash;tales
of war and adventure, tales of bravery and
nobility, tales of the heroes that mankind, almost
since the beginning of time, have looked to as
ideals of wisdom and strength and beauty.

THE ILIAD
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE QUARREL
</h3>

<p>
Leda, Queen of Sparta, bare a daughter, Helen
by name, that grew to be the fairest of all women
upon earth.  She married Menelaus, son of Atreus,
and for a while dwelt in peace with her husband,
bearing him a daughter, Hermione by name.  But
there came to the court of Menelaus, who was by
this time King of Sparta, a certain Paris, second
in birth among the sons of Priam, King of Troy.
Menelaus entertained him hospitably, but Paris
repaid his kindness with evil, for he carried off his
wife, the fair Helen, and took with her many of
the King's possessions.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Le'-da.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Men-e-la'-us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ag-a-mem'-non.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her-mi'-o-ne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A'-treus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Menelaus, with his elder brother Agamemnon,
who was lord of all the Greeks, went to all
the chiefs, and prayed that they would help them
to avenge this wrong.  Thus was a great host
gathered together, even a hundred thousand men,
and eleven hundred fourscore and six ships.
</p>

<p>
For nine years did the Greeks besiege the city
of Troy.  They won, indeed, in the field, but
could not break through the walls.
</p>

<p>
Now because they had been away from their
homes for many years, they were in want of things
needful.  Therefore it was their custom to leave
part of the army to watch the city, and with part
to spoil the cities in the country round about.
And in this way the great quarrel that caused such
trouble to the host came about.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks sacked the city of Chryse, where
was a temple of Apollo, and a priest that served
the temple.  And when they divided the spoil,
they gave to King Agamemnon, with other
gifts, the priest's daughter Chryseis.  Thereupon
Chryses, the priest, came to the camp, wishing to
ransom his daughter.  Much gold he brought with
him, and on his staff of gold he carried the holy
garland, that men might reverence him the more.
He went to all the chiefs, and to the sons of Atreus
first of all, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Chry'-se.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A-pol'-lo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chry-se'-is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chry'-ses.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Loose, I pray you, my dear daughter, and take
the ransom for her; so may the gods that dwell in
Olympus grant you to take the city of Troy, and
to have safe return to your homes."
</p>

<p>
Then all the others spake him fair, and would
have done what he wished.  Only Agamemnon
would not have it so.
</p>

<p>
"Get thee out, graybeard!" he cried in great
wrath.  "Let me not find thee lingering now by
the ships, neither coming hither again, or it shall
be the worse for thee, for all thy priesthood.
And as for thy daughter, I shall carry her away
to Argos, when I shall have taken this city of
Troy."
</p>

<p>
Then the old man went out hastily in great fear
and trouble.  And he walked in his sorrow by the
shore of the sounding sea, and prayed to his god
Apollo.
</p>

<p>
"Hear me, God of the silver bow!  If I have
built thee a temple, and offered thee the fat of many
bullocks and rams, hear me, and avenge my tears
on these Greeks with thine arrows!"
</p>

<p>
And Apollo heard him.  Wroth was he that men
had so dishonoured his priest, and he came down
from the top of Olympus, where he dwelt.  Dreadful
was the rattle of his arrows as he went, and his
coming was as the night when it cometh over the
sky.  Then he shot the arrows of death, first on
the dogs and the mules, and then on the men;
and soon all along the shore rolled the black
smoke from the piles of wood on which they burnt
the bodies of the dead.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
O-lym'-pus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For nine days the shafts of the god went
throughout the host; but on the tenth day Achilles
called the people to an assembly.  So Hera
bade him, for she loved the Greeks, and grieved
to see them die.  When they were gathered
together he stood up among them, and spake to
Agamemnon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
A-chil'-les.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He'-ra.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Surely it were better to return home, than
that we should all perish here by war or plague.
But come, let us ask some prophet, or priest, or
dreamer of dreams, why it is that Apollo is so
wroth with us."
</p>

<p>
Then stood up Calchas, best of prophets, who
knew what had been, and what was, and what
was to come, and spake.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Cal'-chas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  seer, prophet.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Achilles, thou biddest me tell the people why
Apollo is wroth with them.  Lo!  I will tell
thee, but thou must first swear to stand by me,
for I know that what I shall say will anger King
Agamemnon, and it goes ill with common men
when kings are angry."
</p>

<p>
"Speak out, thou wise man!" cried Achilles;
"for I swear by Apollo that while I live no one
shall lay hands on thee, no, not Agamemnon's
self, though he be lord of the Greeks."
</p>

<p>
Then the blameless seer took heart, and spake:
"It is not for vow or offering that Apollo is
wroth; it is for his servant the priest, for he came
to ransom his daughter, but Agamemnon scorned
him, and would not let the maiden go.  Now,
then, ye must send her back without ransom, and
with her a hundred beasts for sacrifice, so that
the plague may be stayed."
</p>

<p>
Then Agamemnon stood up in a fury, his eyes
blazing like fire.
</p>

<p>
"Never," he cried, "hast thou spoken good
concerning me, ill prophet that thou art, and now
thou tellest me to give up this maiden!  I will
do it, for I would not that the people should
perish.  Only take care, ye Greeks, that there be
a share of the spoil for me, for it would be ill if
the lord of all the host should alone be without
his share."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, my lord Agamemnon," cried Achilles,
"thou art too eager for gain.  We have no
treasures out of which we may make up thy loss, for
what we got out of the towns we have either sold
or divided; nor would it be fitting that the people
should give back what has been given to them.
Give up the maiden, then, without conditions,
and when we shall have taken this city of Troy,
we will repay thee three and four fold."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, great Achilles," said Agamemnon, "thou
shalt not cheat me thus.  If the Greeks will give
me such a share as I should have, well and good.
But if not, I will take one for myself, whether it
be from thee, or from Ajax, or from Ulysses; for
my share I will have.  But of this hereafter.
Now let us see that this maiden be sent back.
Let them get ready a ship, and put her therein,
and with her a hundred victims for sacrifice, and
let some chief go with the ship, and see that all
things be rightly done."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
A'-jax.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then cried Achilles, and his face was black as
a thunder-storm: "Surely thou art altogether
shameless and greedy, and, in truth, an ill ruler
of men.  No quarrel have I with the Trojans.
They never seized oxen or sheep of mine in my
native land, for many mountains lie between, and
a great breadth of roaring sea.  But I have been
fighting in thy cause, and that of thy brother.
Naught carest thou for that.  Thou leavest me
to fight, and sittest in thy tent at ease.  But when
the spoil is divided, thine is always the lion's
share.  Small indeed is my part, and this,
forsooth, thou wilt take away!  Now am I resolved
to go home.  I have no mind to heap up goods
and gold for thee, and be myself dishonoured."
</p>

<p>
And King Agamemnon answered: "Go, and
thy Myrmidons with thee!  I have other chieftains
as good as thou art, and ready, as thou art
not, to pay me due respect; and Zeus is with me.
I hate thee, for thou always lovest war and strife.
And as for the matter of the spoil, know that I
will take thy share, the girl Briseis, and fetch her
myself, if need be, that all may know that I am
sovereign lord here in the host of the Greeks."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Myr-mi-dons, the soldiers of Achilles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bri-se'-is.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Achilles was mad with anger, and he
thought in his heart, "Shall I arise and slay him,
or shall I keep down the wrath in my breast?"
And as he thought he laid his hand on his sword-hilt,
and had half drawn his sword from the
scabbard, when lo! the goddess Athene stood behind
him (for Hera, who loved both chieftains had
sent her), and caught him by the long locks of his
yellow hair.  Achilles marvelled much to feel the
mighty grasp, and turned, and looked, and knew
the goddess, but no one else in the assembly
could see her.  Terrible was the flash of his eyes
as he cried: "Art thou come, child of Zeus, to
see the insolence of Agamemnon?  Of a truth, I
think that he will perish for his folly."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
A-the'-ne.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Athene said: "Nay, I am come from heaven
to calm thy wrath, if thou wilt hear me; white-armed
Hera sent me, for she loveth and cherisheth
you both alike.  Draw not thy sword; but use
bitter words, even as thou wilt.  Of a truth, I tell
thee that for this insolence of to-day he will bring
thee hereafter splendid gifts, threefold and fourfold
for all that he may take away.  Only restrain
thyself and do my bidding."
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles answered: "I will abide by thy
command in spite of my wrath, for the man who
hearkens to the immortal gods is also heard by
them."  And as he spake he laid his heavy hand
upon the hilt, and thrust back the sword into the
scabbard, and Athene went her way to Olympus.
</p>

<p>
Then he turned him to King Agamemnon,
and spake again, for his anger was not spent:
"Drunkard, with the eyes of a dog and the heart
of a deer! never fighting in the front of the
battle, nor daring to lie in the ambush!  This I
tell thee, and confirm my words with a mighty
oath&mdash;by this sceptre do I swear.  Once it was
the branch of a tree; and as surely as it shall
never again have bark, or leaves, or shoots, so
surely shall the Greeks one day miss Achilles,
when they fall in heaps before the dreadful
Hector; and thou shalt eat thy heart for rage,
to think that thou hast wronged the bravest of
thy host."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake he dashed the sceptre upon
the ground, and sat down.  And on the other
side Agamemnon sat in furious anger.  Then
Nestor rose, an old man of a hundred years and
more, and counselled peace.  Let them listen, he
said, to his counsel.  Great chiefs in the old days,
with whom no man now alive would dare to fight,
had listened to him.  Let not Agamemnon take
away from the bravest of the Greeks the prize of
war; let not Achilles, though he was mightier in
battle than all other men, contend with Agamemnon,
who was sovereign lord of all the hosts of
Greece.  But he spake in vain.  For Agamemnon
answered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Nestor, thou speakest well, and peace is good.
But this fellow would lord it over all; yet there
are some, methinks, who will not obey him.  For
if the immortal gods have made him a great
warrior, do they therefore grant him leave to speak
lawless words?  Verily he must be taught that
there is one here, at least, who is better than
he."
</p>

<p>
And Achilles said: "I would be a slave and
a coward if I owned thee as my lord.  Play the
master over others, but think not to master me.
As for the prize which the Greeks gave me, let
them do as they will.  They gave it; let them
take it away.  But if thou darest to touch aught
that is mine own, that hour thy life-blood shall
redden on my spear."
</p>

<p>
Then the assembly was dismissed.  Chryseis
was sent to her home with due offerings to the
god, the wise Ulysses going with her.  And all
the people purified themselves, and offered
sacrifices to the gods; and the sweet savour went up
to heaven in the wreathing smoke.
</p>

<p>
But King Agamemnon would not go back from
his purpose, So he called to him the heralds,
Talthybius and Eurybates, and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Tal-thyb'-i-us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Eu-ryb'-a-tes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Heralds, go to the tents of Achilles, and fetch
the maiden Briseis.  But if he will not let her
go, say that I will come myself with many others
to fetch her; and it will be the worse for him."
</p>

<p>
Sorely against their will the heralds went.
Along the seashore they walked, till they came
to where, amidst the Myrmidons, were the tents
of Achilles.  There they found him, sitting
between his tent and his ship.  He did not rejoice
to see them, and they stood in great terror and
shame.  But he knew in his heart wherefore they
had come, and cried aloud: "Come near, ye
heralds, messengers of gods and men.  'Tis no
fault of yours that ye are come on such an
errand."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to Patroclus, his dearest friend,
and said: "Bring the maiden from her tent, and
let the heralds lead her away.  But let them be
witnesses, before gods and men, and before this
evil-minded king, that the day will come when he
shall have sore need of me to save his host from
destruction."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Pa-tro'-clus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Patroclus brought forth the maiden from
her tent, and gave her to the heralds.  And
they led her away, sorely against her will.  But
Achilles went apart from his comrades, and sat
upon the seashore, falling into a great passion
of tears, and stretching out his hands with loud
prayer to his mother, Thetis, daughter of the sea.
She heard him where she sat in the depths by her
father, the old god of the sea, and rose from the
gray sea, as a vapour rises, and came to where he
sat weeping, and stroked him with her hand, and
hailed him by his name.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
The'-tis.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What ails thee, my son?" she said.
</p>

<p>
Then he told her the story of his wrong, and
when he had ended he said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Go, I pray thee, to the top of Olympus, to
the palace of Zeus.  Often have I heard thee boast
how, long ago, thou didst help him when the other
gods would have bound him, fetching Briareus of
the hundred hands, who sat by him in his strength,
so that the gods feared to touch him.  Go now,
and call these things to his mind, and pray him
that he help the sons of Troy, and give them
victory in the battle, so that the Greeks, as they
flee before them, may have joy of this king of
theirs, who has done such wrong to the bravest of
his host."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Bri-a'-re-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And his mother answered him: "Surely thine
is an evil lot, my son.  Thy life is short, and it
should of right be without tears and full of joy;
but now it seems to me to be both short and sad.
But I will go as thou sayest to Olympus, to the
palace of Zeus; but not now, for he has gone, and
the other gods with him, to a twelve days' feast
with the pious Ethiopians.  But when he comes
back I will entreat and persuade him.  And do
thou sit still, nor go forth to battle."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ulysses drew near to Chryse with
the holy offerings.  And when they were come
within the haven, they furled the sail, and laid it
in the ship, and lowered the mast, and rowed the
ship to her moorings.  They cast out the anchor
stones, and made fast the cables from the stern.
After that they landed, taking with them the
offerings and the maid Chryseis.  To the altar
they brought the maid, and gave her into the arms
of her father, and the wise Ulysses said: "See
now; Agamemnon, king of men, sends back thy
daughter, and with her a hundred beasts for sacrifice,
that we may appease the god who hath smitten
the Greeks in his wrath."
</p>

<p>
Then the priest received his daughter right
gladly, and when they had ranged the beasts about
the altar, then the priest prayed, "Hear me, God
of the silver bow!  If before thou didst hearken
to my prayer, and grievously afflict the Greeks,
so hear me now, and stay this plague which is
come upon them."
</p>

<p>
So prayed he, and the god gave ear.
</p>

<p>
Then they slew the cattle, and flayed them, and
burned an offering to the gods.  Then they cut
up the rest, and broiled the pieces carefully on
spits.  This being done, they made their meal,
nor did any one lack his share.  And when the
meal was ended, then they poured a little wine
into the cups to serve for an offering to the gods.
After that they sat till sunset, singing a hymn to
the Archer God, and making merry; and he heard
their voice and was pleased.
</p>

<p>
When the sun went down they slept beside the
stern-cables; and when the dawn appeared then
they embarked, raising the mast and spreading
the sail; and Apollo sent them a favouring wind,
and the dark blue wave hissed about the ship
as she went: so they came to the camp of the
Greeks.
</p>

<p>
But all the time Achilles sat in wrath beside his
ships; he went not to the war, nor yet to the
assembly, but sat fretting in his heart, because he
longed for the cry of the battle.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE ASSEMBLY
</h3>

<p>
When the twelfth day was come, Thetis rose
out of the sea, and went to high Olympus.  There
she found Zeus sitting apart on the topmost peak
of Olympus, and she knelt down before him; with
her left hand she clasped his knees, and with her
right she took his beard, and she made her prayer
unto him.
</p>

<p>
"O Father Zeus, if ever I have aided thee by
word or deed, fulfil now my prayer.  Give honour,
I beseech thee, to Achilles my son, who hath so
short a space of life; for now Agamemnon hath
put dishonour upon him, taking away the gift
that the Greeks gave him.  Grant, therefore,
that the men of Troy may for a while gain the
victory so that the Greeks may do honour to my
son."
</p>

<p>
So she spake, and Zeus sat a long time silent;
but Thetis would not loose her hold.  Then she
spake again: "Give me now thy promise, and
confirm it with a nod, or else deny me.  So shall
I know that I am held least in honour of all the
gods."
</p>

<p>
Then Zeus made answer much disturbed: "This
is a hard matter, for thou wilt set me at strife
with Hera, and she will upbraid me with bitter
words.  Even now she is ever reproaching me,
saying that I favour the men of Troy in the battle.
Therefore go thou away, that she may not know
of thy coming; and I will consider how this
thing may be best accomplished.  And now I will
assure my promise with a nod; for when I give
my nod, then the thing may not be repented of
or left undone."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and nodded with his dark brows,
and the hair waved about his head, and all
Olympus was shaken.
</p>

<p>
Then Thetis departed, diving into the deep sea,
and Zeus went to his own house, and all the gods
rose up before him.  And when he sat upon his
chair, then Hera, knowing that Thetis of the
silver feet had held counsel with him, addressed
him with bitter words.
</p>

<p>
"Who hath been in council with thee, thou
plotter?  Thou dost always take pleasure, when I
am absent, in secret plans, and never tellest thy
thought to me freely."
</p>

<p>
To her the father of gods and men made reply:
"Hera, think not to know all my thoughts; that
would be too hard for thee, even though thou art
my wife.  That which is fitting thou shalt hear
first; but into such counsel as I take by myself
inquire thou not."
</p>

<p>
Hera answered: "What sayest thou?  I have
not pried into thy plans.  These thou makest as
thou wilt.  And now I sorely fear that Thetis of
the silver feet hath persuaded thee.  At dawn of
day I saw her kneeling before thee; thou hast
granted, I doubt not, that Achilles shall have
honour, and that many of the Greeks shall die
beside their ships."
</p>

<p>
To this Zeus made reply: "Verily nothing escapeth
thee, thou witch.  If it be as thou sayest, such
is my will.  Do thou sit silent, and obey.  Else all
the gods in Olympus shall not save thee, when I
lay upon thee the hands that none may resist."
</p>

<p>
Then Hera was afraid, and held her peace, and
all the gods were troubled.  But her son Hephæstus,
the smith, spake, saying: "This indeed will
be grievous, if ye two come to strife for the sake
of mortal men, and make trouble among the gods.
If such ill counsels prevail, what pleasure shall we
have in our feasting?  Now will I advise my
mother that she make peace with Zeus, lest he
rebuke her again.  If he were minded to hurl her
from these seats, who should withstand him?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
He-phæs'-tus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Thereupon he put the double-handled cup into his
mother's hand, and said: "Have patience, mother,
for all that thou art vexed, lest I see thee beaten
before mine eyes.  I could not help thee.  Once
before when I would have succoured thee, he
grasped me by the foot, and flung me from the
threshold of heaven.  All day I fell, and at
sunset I lighted in Lemnos."
</p>

<p>
Then Hera smiled, and took the cup from her
son.  And he went round to all the gods, going
from left to right as a cupbearer should, and
poured the nectar from the mixing-bowl, and
laughter without end awoke among the blessed
gods, when they saw the limping Hephæstus go
puffing through the hall.
</p>

<p>
Gods and men slept that night; but Zeus slept
not, for he thought in his heart how he might
do honour to Achilles.  And as he thought, he
judged it best to send a deceiving dream to
Agamemnon.  Therefore he said: "Go, deceiving
Dream, to the swift ships of the Greeks, and seek
the tent of Agamemnon.  Bid him make haste
and arm the Greeks, for he shall surely take the
city of Troy."
</p>

<p>
So the dream went to the tent of Agamemnon,
and found him wrapped in sleep.  It took the
shape of Nestor, the old chief, whom the King
honoured more than all besides.
</p>

<p>
Then the false Nestor spake: "Sleepest thou,
Agamemnon?  It is not for kings to sleep all
through the night, for they must take thought for
many, and have many cares.  Listen now to the
words of Zeus: 'Set the battle in array against
Troy, for the gods are now of one mind, and the
day of doom is come for the city, and thou shalt
take it, and gain everlasting glory for thyself.'"
</p>

<p>
And Agamemnon believed the dream.  So he
rose from his bed, and donned his tunic, and put
over it a great cloak, and fastened the sandals on
his feet, and hung from his shoulders his mighty
silver-studded sword, and took in his right hand
the great sceptre of his house, which was the token
of his sovereignty over all the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
First he called a council of the chiefs by the
ship of King Nestor; and when they were seated,
he said: "Hear me, my friends.  This night a
dream came to me in my sleep; most like it was
to Nestor.  Above my head it stood, and said:
'Thou sleepest, son of Atreus.  It is not for kings
to sleep all through the night.  Now mark my
word; I come to thee from Zeus, who careth for
thee, though he be far away.  He bids thee call
the Greeks to battle, for now thou shalt take the
city of Troy.'  So spake the Dream.  Come, therefore,
let us rouse the Greeks; but first I will try
their spirit, counselling them to flee to their homes,
and do ye dissuade them."
</p>

<p>
Then up rose Nestor in his place and spake:
"Had any other told us this dream, we had thought
it false; but seeing that he who hath seen it is
chief among us, let us call the people to arms."
</p>

<p>
Then the heralds made proclamation, and the
people hastened to their places.  Even as the bees
swarm from a hollow rock and cluster about the
flowers of spring, and some fly this way and some
that, so the many tribes marched from the ships
and the tents to the place of the assembly.  Great
was the confusion and great the uproar, and nine
heralds sought to quiet the people, that they might
listen to the speaking of the kings; and at the
last the Greeks ceased from their shouting, and
sat in their places.
</p>

<p>
Then Agamemnon rose up, holding the sceptre
in his hand, and spake thus: "O my friends, ill
hath Zeus dealt with me.  He promised me that
I should take the city of Troy, and so return to
my home.  But his words were deceitful, for now
he bids me go back to Argos.  Nine years have
passed, and the timbers of our ships are rotted,
and the rigging is worn; and our wives and our
children sit at home and wait for us.  Come, therefore,
let us flee to the land of our fathers, for Troy
we may not take."
</p>

<p>
So spake the King, and stirred the hearts of the
people; that is to say, of all that knew not his
secret counsel.  All the assembly was moved as
the sea is moved, when the east wind raiseth the
waves, or as a cornfield, when the strong west
wind comes upon it, and shakes the ears.
Shouting they hasted to the ships, and laid hands on
them to drag them down.
</p>

<p>
Then would the Greeks have returned home
again.  But Hera spake to Athene: "Will the
Greeks thus idly flee to their homes? and will
they leave Helen to Priam and to Troy,&mdash;Helen,
for whom so many have fallen far from their
fatherland?  Hasten now, and turn them from
their purpose."
</p>

<p>
So Athene hastened down from Olympus, and
she found Ulysses, who had laid no hand upon his
ship, for grief had touched him to his heart.  To
him she said: "Son of Laertes, will ye indeed flee
to your fatherland, and leave Helen, for whom so
many have fallen, to be a boast to Priam and the
men of Troy?  Go now, and dissuade the Greeks,
and suffer them not to drag their ships to the
sea."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
La-er'-tes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And when Ulysses heard the voice of the goddess,
he cast away his cloak, and ran.  King Agamemnon
gave him his sceptre, and, bearing that,
he went among the ships.  When he saw a chief,
he said with gentle words, "Hold, sir, it ill
becomes thee to be a coward; sit still and hold
the people back.  Thou knowest not the mind
of the King; he did but make trial of the
spirit of the Greeks.  Anger him not, lest he do
some mischief to the people."
</p>

<p>
But when he saw a common man, he smote
him with his sceptre, and said: "Fellow, sit still,
and listen to them that are better than thou.
Let there be one master, one king, to whom Zeus
has given authority."
</p>

<p>
Thus did he turn them from their purpose.
And they hasted again to the assembly with such
a noise as when a wave breaks along the shore.
</p>

<p>
But, when all the rest were silent, Thersites
alone jeered at the princes, that he might move
laughter among the Greeks.  Most ill-favoured
was he of all that came to Troy, bandy-legged,
and halting on one foot, with a hump on his back,
narrow-chested, and his head misshapen, with
straggling hair thereon.  Loud he shouted now,
reviling Agamemnon:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Ther-si'-tes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What lackest thou yet, son of Atreus?  Full
of bronze are thy tents, and many are the fair
women whom we have given thee.  Wantest thou
more than these?  Surely a leader of men should
not bring the Greeks into trouble.  And ye, who
are women rather than men, why sail ye not
home, and leave this man to gorge himself with
his spoils alone?  For now he hath wronged
Achilles, taking away his gift&mdash;Achilles, who is
far better than he.  Surely Achilles is mild of
temper, or this, son of Atreus, had been thy last
wrong-doing!"
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Ulysses rose up beside him, and
spake in wrath: "Peace, babbler; take not the
name of kings upon thy lips, nor taunt thy betters.
Hearken now to me: if I hear thee speak idle
words again as thou hast done this day, I will
surely strip from off thee cloak and tunic, and
drive thee to the ships with shameful blows."  So
speaking, he smote him with the sceptre on back
and shoulders; and a bloody weal rose up beneath
the blow.  All dazed, the fellow cowered
down and wiped away his tears.
</p>

<p>
Merrily laughed the others, saying one to his
neighbour: "Often hath Ulysses done well, but
never better than now, when he hath stopped this
babbler's tongue.  He will not rail against the
kings again."
</p>

<p>
Then Ulysses stood up to speak, holding the
sceptre in his hand; and Athene stood by his
side, in the likeness of a herald, bidding the
people keep silence, that all, nearest and farthest
alike, might hear his words.
</p>

<p>
"Now, O King," he said, "the Greeks are
shaming thee, abiding no more by their promise
which they made thee coming from Argos; that
they would not return till they had taken the
city of Troy.  Truly there is toil enough here
to make us sick of heart and wishful to return.
For a man will feel weary if he be kept but a
single moon from his wife by winter winds and
stormy sea, and we have lingered here for twelve
moons nine times told.  But it is not well to
tarry long and come back empty-handed, after
all.  Ye all remember the prophecy that was
given when we set sail from Greece,&mdash;all whom
death hath not carried away,&mdash;that for nine
years we should make war, and in the tenth we
should take the fair city of Troy.  Remain,
therefore, ye Greeks, till ye have taken Priam's
mighty town."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and all the Greeks shouted in assent;
and the ships sent back the shout as if it
had been thunder.
</p>

<p>
Then King Agamemnon stood up, and said:
"Go now to your meal, and afterwards we will
join the battle.  Let every man whet well his
spear, and fit his shield, and feed his horses
abundantly, and look to his chariot, that all day long
we may fight, and cease not, even for a little space,
till night shall come and separate the hosts.  Truly
the band of the shield shall grow wet, and the
hand be weary that holdeth the spear, and the
horse shall sweat that draweth the polished chariot.
And whoever holdeth back from the fight, tarrying
at the ships, nothing shall save him from feeding
the dogs and the fowls of the air."
</p>

<p>
Then the Greeks shouted again.  Quickly did
they scatter themselves among the ships and the
tents, and make their meal.  And Agamemnon
made a feast, and called thereto the chiefs, Nestor
and Idomeneus, and Ajax the Greater and Ajax
the Less, and Diomed, and Ulysses; but Menelaus
came uncalled, knowing that he would be welcome.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
I-do'-me-neus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Di'-o-med.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then King Agamemnon stood up and prayed:
"O Zeus, let not the sun set and the darkness fall
before I humble Priam's roof in the dust, and burn
his doors with fire, and rend the coat of Hector on
his breast!"
</p>

<p>
So he prayed, but Zeus hearkened not.
</p>

<p>
And when the feast was ended, the chiefs
marshalled their hosts for the battle; and Athene
in the midst swept through the host, urging them
to the conflict; and in every heart she roused the
delight of battle, so that there was no man but
would have chosen war rather than to return to
his home.  As is the flare of a great fire when
a wood is burning on a hilltop, so was the flash
of their arms and their armour, as they thronged
to the field.  And as the countless flocks of wild
geese or cranes or swans now wheel and now
settle in the great Asian swamp, or as the bees
swarm in the spring, when the milk-pails are full,
so thick the Greeks thronged to the battle in the
great plain by the banks of the Scamander.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS
</h3>

<p>
So now the hosts drew near to battle.  With
many a cry the men of Troy came on, clamorous
as a flock of cranes when they fly southward from
the winter and the rain.  But the Greeks marched
in silence, resolute to stand by one another in the
battle; and beneath their feet rose up a great
cloud of dust, thick as the mist which the south
wind brings over the mountain-tops.
</p>

<p>
They were now about to fight, when from the
ranks of the Trojans Paris rushed forth.  He had
a panther's skin over his shoulders, and a bow and
a sword, and in either hand a spear, and he called
aloud to the Greeks that they should send forth
their bravest to fight with him.  But when
Menelaus saw him he was glad, for he said that now he
should avenge himself on the man who had done
him such wrong.  He leapt from his chariot and
rushed to meet his enemy; but Paris was afraid
when he saw Menelaus, and fled back into the ranks
of his comrades, just as a man steps back in haste
when unawares in a mountain glen he comes upon
a snake.  But Hector saw him, and rebuked him:
"Fair art thou to look upon, Paris, but nothing
worth.  Surely the Greeks will scorn us if they
think that thou art our bravest warrior, because
thou art of stately presence.  But thou art a
coward; and yet thou daredst to go across the sea
and carry off the fair Helen.  Why dost thou not
stand and abide the onset of her husband, and see
what manner of man he is?  Little would thy harp
and thy long locks and thy fair face avail when
thou wert lying in the dust!  A craven race are
the sons of Troy, or they would have stoned thee
ere this."
</p>

<p>
Then Paris answered: "Thou speakest well,
Hector, and thy rebuke is just.  As for thee,
thy heart is like iron, ever set on battle; yet are
beauty and love also the gifts of the gods, and not
to be despised.  But now set Menelaus and me
in the midst, and let us fight, man to man, for the
fair Helen and for all her possessions.  And if he
prevail over me, let him take her and them and
depart, and the Greeks with him, leaving you to
dwell in peace; but if I prevail they shall depart
without her."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector was glad, and going before the
Trojan ranks, holding his spear by the middle, he
kept them back.  But the Greeks would have
shot at him with arrows and slung stones, only
Agamemnon cried aloud and said, "Hold, Hector
has somewhat to say to us."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector said: "Hear, Trojans and Greeks,
what Paris saith, Paris who hath bred this quarrel
between us: 'Let all lay their arms upon the
ground, and let Menelaus and me fight for the
fair Helen, and all her wealth.  And let him that
is the better keep her and them, but the rest shall
swear faith and friendship.'"
</p>

<p>
Then Menelaus stood up and spake: "Listen
to me, for this trouble toucheth me nearer than
you all.  The Greeks and the men of Troy would
fain be at peace, for they have suffered grievous
things because of my quarrel and of the wrong
that Paris did.  Therefore we two will fight
together, and let him perish who is doomed to die.
Bring two sheep, ye men of Troy, a white wether
for the sun, and a black ewe for the earth, and we
will bring another for Zeus.  And let Priam
himself come, and do sacrifice, and take the oath.
Young men are ever changeable; but when an old
man is among them, he taketh thought for all."
</p>

<p>
So spake Menelaus; and both the armies were
glad, hoping to see an end of the war.
</p>

<p>
Then Hector sent a herald to the city, to summon
Priam to the sacrifice and to fetch the sheep.
And while he went, Iris, in the guise of Laodice,
fairest of the daughters of Priam, came to Helen,
where she sat in her hall, weaving a great web of
double breadth and dyed with purple, whereon
she had wrought many battles of the Greeks and
the men of Troy, Iris came near and said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
La-o'-di-ce.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Come, dear sister, and behold this marvel.
Heretofore the Greeks and the men of Troy have
fought together on the plain, but now they sit in
peace, and the war is stayed; for Paris and Menelaus
are to fight for thee, and thou shalt be the
wife of him that shall prevail."
</p>

<p>
So spake the goddess, and roused in Helen
sweet longing for her former husband, and her
city, and her parents.  So she wrapped herself in
white apparel, and went forth from her chamber.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Priam sat on the wall with the old
men.  They had ceased from war, but in speech
they were to be admired; they were like to the
crickets that sit upon a tree in the wood, and
send forth a thin, sweet voice.  And as they
talked, the fair Helen came near, and they said:
"What wonder that men should suffer much for
such a woman, for indeed she is divinely fair!
Yet let her depart in the ships, nor bring a curse
on us and our children."
</p>

<p>
But Priam called to her: "Come near, my
daughter, that thou mayest see him that was thy
husband, and thy friends and kinsmen.  I find
no fault with thee, for 'tis not thou, 'tis the gods
who have brought about all this trouble.  But
tell me, who is this warrior that I see, so fair and
strong?  There are others even a head taller than
he, but none of such majesty."
</p>

<p>
And Helen answered: "Ah, my father!  I
owe thee much reverence; yet would that I had
died before I left husband and child to follow thy
son.  But as for this warrior, he is Agamemnon, a
good king and brave soldier, and my brother-in-law
in the old days."
</p>

<p>
"Happy Agamemnon," said Priam, "to rule
over so many!  Never saw I such an army
gathered together.  But who is this that I see, not
so tall as Agamemnon, but of broader shoulders?
His arms lie upon the ground, and he is walking
through the ranks of his men just as some great
ram walks through a flock of sheep."
</p>

<p>
"This," said Helen, "is Ulysses of Ithaca, who
is better in craft and counsel than all other men."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well spoken, lady," said Antenor.  "Well
I remember Ulysses when he came hither on an
embassy about thee with the brave Menelaus.
My guests they were, and I knew them well.
And I remember how, in the assembly of the
Trojans, when both were standing, Menelaus was
the taller, but when they sat, Ulysses was the
more majestic to behold.  And when they rose
to speak, Menelaus said few words, but said them
wisely and well; and Ulysses&mdash;you had thought
him a fool, so stiffly he held his sceptre and so
downcast were his eyes; but as soon as he began,
oh! the mighty voice, and the words thick as the
falling snow!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
An-te'-nor.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Priam said, "Who is that stalwart hero,
so tall and strong, overtopping all by head and
shoulders?"
</p>

<p>
"That," said Helen, "is mighty Ajax, the
bulwark of the Greeks.  And next to him is
Idomeneus.  Often has Menelaus had him as
his guest in the old days, when he came from
Crete.  As for the other chiefs, I see and could
name them all.  But I miss my own dear brothers,
Castor, tamer of horses, and Pollux, the mighty
boxer.  Either they came not from Sparta, or,
having come, shun the meeting of men for shame
of me."
</p>

<p>
So she spake, and knew not that they were
sleeping their last sleep far away in their dear
fatherland.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the sheep
from the town, and wine in a goatskin; and
Idæus, the herald, carried a bowl and golden
cups.  He came near to King Priam, and told
him how the armies called for him.  So he went,
and he, on the one side, for the Trojans, and
King Agamemnon for the Greeks, made a
covenant with sacrifice that Paris and Menelaus
should fight together, and that the fair Helen,
with all her treasures, should go with him who
should prevail.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
I-dæ'-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And when the sacrifice and the prayers were
ended, King Priam said: "I will go back to
Troy, for I could not endure to see my son
fighting with Menelaus.  But which of the two
is doomed to death, Zeus and the immortal gods
only know."
</p>

<p>
So he spake and climbed into his chariot and
took the reins; so he went back to Troy even as
he came.
</p>

<p>
And afterwards Hector and Ulysses marked
out a space for the fight, and Hector shook
two pebbles in a helmet, looking away as he
shook them, that he whose pebble leapt forth
the first should be the first to throw his spear.
And so it befell that the lot of Paris leapt forth
first.  Then the two warriors armed themselves,
and came forth into the space, and stood over
against each other, brandishing their spears,
with hate in their eyes.  Then Paris threw his
spear.  It struck the shield of Menelaus, but
pierced it not, for the spear point was bent back.
Then Menelaus prayed to Zeus: "Grant, Father
Zeus, that I may avenge myself on Paris, who
has done me this wrong; so shall men in after
time fear to do wrong to their host."  So speaking,
he cast his long-shafted spear.  It struck
the shield of Paris and pierced it through, and
passed through the corselet, and through the
tunic; but Paris shrank aside, and the spear
wounded him not.  Then Menelaus drew his
silver-studded sword and struck a mighty blow
on the top of the helmet of Paris, but the sword
broke in four pieces in his hand.  Then he cried
in his wrath, "O Zeus, most mischief-loving of
the gods, my spear I cast in vain, and now my
sword is broken."  Then he rushed forward and
seized Paris by the helmet, and dragged him
towards the hosts of the Greeks, for he was choked
by the band of the helmet.  And truly he had
taken him, but Aphrodite loosed the strap that
was beneath the chin, and the helmet came off
in his hand.  And Menelaus whirled it among
the Greeks and charged with another spear in
his hand.  But Aphrodite snatched Paris away,
covering him with a mist, and put him down in
his chamber in Troy.  Then Menelaus looked
for him everywhere, but no one could tell him
where he might be.  No son of Troy would have
hidden him out of kindness, for all hated him as
death.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Aph-ro-di'-te.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then King Agamemnon said, "Now, ye sons
of Troy, it is for you to give back the fair
Helen and her wealth, and to pay me, besides, so
much as may be fitting for all my cost and trouble."
</p>

<p>
So spake King Agamemnon, and the Greeks
applauded.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE BROKEN OATH
</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile the gods sat in council in the
hall of Zeus; and fair Hebe poured out for them
the nectar, and they pledged each other in cups of
gold, looking down upon the city of Troy.  Then
spake Zeus, seeking to provoke Hera with taunting
words:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
He'-be.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Two helpers hath Menelaus among the goddesses,
even Hera and Athene.  But now they sit
still and take their pleasure, while Aphrodite
walketh beside Paris, and delivereth him from
instant death.  Yet, seeing that Menelaus hath
prevailed, let us consider what shall next be done.
Shall we stir up war again, or make peace between
the hosts?  If it please you to make peace, then
let Menelaus take Helen to his home again, and
let Priam's city continue."
</p>

<p>
So he spake.  But Hera and Athene sat wrathful
side by side, meditating evil in their hearts
against the men of Troy.  Athene kept silence, in
spite of the fury that raged within her, but Hera
could not contain her wrath, and spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What is this thou sayest?  Wouldst thou make
void all my toil and trouble, with which I have
gathered this people together, that Priam and his
sons may be destroyed?  Do as thou wilt; but
it pleaseth not the other gods."
</p>

<p>
To her Zeus spake in answer wrathfully: "Tell
us what evil have Priam and the sons of Priam
done in thy sight that thou desirest so pitilessly
the downfall of this fair city of Troy?  Verily
wert thou to pass within the gates, and eat Priam
raw, and his sons with him, then might thy hate
be satisfied.  Do, then, as thou wilt.  Let not
this matter breed ill-will betwixt me and thee.
Yet remember what I say.  If I be minded to
destroy in time to come some city that thou lovest,
say me not nay, nor hinder me, for in this have I
yielded to thy will.  Verily of all the cities of
men that lie beneath the stars, I have loved Troy
the best.  Never there has my altar failed of
feast and banquet and the sweet savour that is the
due of gods."
</p>

<p>
Then Hera answered: "Three cities have I that
I love, Argos and Sparta and Mycenæ.  If they
have offended thee, destroy them; I begrudge
them not; nor, indeed, could I withstand thy will.
Yet my toil also should not be made vain; for I,
too, am a daughter of Chronos, and first in place
among the immortals, seeing that I am thy wife,
who art the King.  Come, therefore, let us yield
to one another, and the other gods will follow us.
Let now Athene go down, and bring it to pass
that some one of the Trojans begin the strife and
break the truce."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
My-ce'-næ.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Thus she ended, and Zeus said not nay, but
spake straightway to Athene: "Make haste, get
thee down to the host, and bring it to pass that
the men of Troy break the truce."
</p>

<p>
So Athene sped down from the top of Olympus,
like to a star which Zeus sends as a sign to
sailors on the sea, or to some host that goeth
forth to battle; and wonder cometh upon all
that behold it.
</p>

<p>
Among the host of Troy she went, taking upon
herself the shape of Laodocus, son of Antenor,
and went to Pandarus, where he stood among his
men.  Then the false Laodocus said: "Pandarus,
darest thou aim an arrow at Menelaus.  Truly
the Trojans would love thee well, and Paris best
of all, if they could see Menelaus slain by an
arrow from thy bow.  Aim then, but first pray to
Apollo, and vow that thou wilt offer a hundred
beasts when thou returnest to thy city."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
La-o'-do-cus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pan'-da-rus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Now Pandarus had a bow made of the horns of
a wild goat which he had slain; sixteen palms
long were the horns, and a cunning workman had
made them smooth, and put a tip of gold whereon
to fasten the bow-string.  And Pandarus strung
his bow, his comrades hiding him with their shields.
Then he took an arrow from his quiver, and laid
it on the bow-string, and drew the string to his
breast, till the arrow-head touched the bow, and
let fly.  Right well aimed was the dart, but it
was not the will of heaven that it should slay
Menelaus.  For the daughter of Zeus stood before
him, and turned aside the shaft, waving it from
him as a mother waveth a fly from her child when
he lieth asleep.  She guided it to where the golden
clasps of the belt came together, and the breast-plate
overlapped.  It passed through the belt, and
through the corselet, and through the girdle, and
pierced the skin.  Then the red blood rushed out
and stained the white skin.
</p>

<p>
Sore dismayed was King Agamemnon to see the
blood; sore dismayed also was the brave Menelaus,
till he spied the barb of the arrow, and knew
that the wound was not deep.  But Agamemnon
cried: "It was in an evil hour for thee, my brother,
that I made a covenant with these false sons of
Troy.  Right well, indeed, I know that oath and
sacrifice are not in vain.  For though Zeus fulfil
not now his purpose, yet will he take vengeance
at the last, and the guilty shall suffer, they and
their wives, and their children.  Troy shall fall;
but woe is me if thou shouldst die, Menelaus.
For the Greeks will straightway go back to their
fatherland, and the fair Helen will be left a boast
to the sons of Troy, and I shall have great shames
when one of them shall say, as he leaps on the
tomb of the brave Menelaus, 'Surely the great
Agamemnon has avenged himself well; for he
brought an army hither, but now has gone back
to his home, and left Menelaus here.'  May the
earth swallow me up before that day!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Menelaus; "fear not, for the arrow
hath but grazed the skin."
</p>

<p>
Then King Agamemnon bade fetch Machaon,
the physician.  And Machaon came, and drew
forth the arrow, and when he had wiped away the
blood he put healing drugs upon the wound.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Ma-cha'-on.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But while this was doing, King Agamemnon
went throughout the host, and if he saw any one
stirring himself to get ready for the battle he
praised him and gave him good encouragement;
but whomsoever he saw halting and lingering and
slothful, him he blamed and rebuked, whether he
were common man or chief.
</p>

<p>
So he passed through all the host.  And the
Greeks went forward to the battle, as the waves
that curl themselves, then dash upon the shore,
throwing high the foam.  In order they went
after their chiefs; you would have thought then
dumb, so silent were they.  But the Trojans were
like a flock of ewes which wait to be milked, and
bleat hearing the voice of their lambs, so confused
a cry went out from their army, for there were
men of many tongues gathered together.  And
on either side the gods urged them on.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE VALIANT DEEDS OF DIOMED
</h3>

<p>
When the armies were come into one place,
they dashed together with buckler and spear:
and there was a great crash of shields that met.
Next rose up a great moaning of them that were
stricken down, and shouting of the conquerors;
and the ground ran with blood.  As when two
torrents, swollen with rains of winter, join their
waters in a hollow ravine at the meeting of the
glens, and the shepherds hear the din far off among
the hills, even so, with a mighty noise and great
confusion, did the two armies meet.
</p>

<p>
Then did the Greeks beat back the men of
Troy.  And each of the chiefs slew a foe; but
there was none like Diomed, who raged through
the battle so furiously that you could not tell with
which host he was, whether with the Greeks or
with the sons of Troy.  Then Pandarus aimed an
arrow at him, and smote him in the right shoulder
as he was rushing forward, and cried aloud: "On,
great-hearted sons of Troy, the bravest of the
Greeks is wounded!  Soon, methinks, will his
strength fail him, unless Apollo has deceived me."
</p>

<p>
So he spake exulting, but the arrow quelled
not Diomed.  Only he leapt down from the
chariot, and spake to Sthenelus, his charioteer,
"Come down, and draw this arrow from my
shoulder."  Then Sthenelus drew it, and the
blood spurted out from the wound.  And Diomed
prayed to Athene: "O Goddess, if ever thou
didst love my father, and stand beside him in
the fiery war, be thou a friend to me also; let
me come within a spear's cast of this man who
hath wounded me, and who boasteth himself over
me, saying that I shall not long look upon the
shining of the sun."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Sthen'-e-lus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So he prayed, and Athene heard; and she
made light his hands and his feet, and stood
beside him, and spake: "Be bold now, O Diomed,
and fight with the men of Troy!  I have breathed
into thy heart the spirit that was in thy father,
and I have taken away the mist that was upon thy
eyes, that thou mayest know god from man.
Fight not thou with any of the immortals, if a
god should come in thy way; only if Aphrodite
comes into the battle, her thou mayest wound."
</p>

<p>
So spake Athene, and went her way; and
Diomed turned back to the battle, and mingled
with the foremost.  Eager he had been before
to fight, but now his eagerness was increased
threefold.  Even as a lion whom a shepherd
wounds a little as he leaps into the fold, but
kills not, and the man escapes into his house,
and the sheep flee in their terror, falling huddled
in a heap, even so did Diomed rage among the
men of Troy.
</p>

<p>
Æneas saw him, and thought how he might
stay him in his course.  So he passed through
the host till he found Pandarus.  "Pandarus," he
said, "where are thy bow and arrows?  See how
this man deals death through the ranks.  Send
a shaft at him, first making thy prayer to Zeus."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Æ-ne'-as.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Pandarus answered: "This man, methinks,
is Diomed.  The shield and the helmet
and the horses are his.  And yet I know not
whether he is not a god.  Some god, at least,
stands by him and guards him.  But now I sent
an arrow at him, and smote him on the shoulder,
right through the corselet, and thought that I
had slain him; but lo! I have harmed him not
at all.  And now I know not what to do, for
here I have no chariot.  I came, trusting in my
bow, and lo! it has failed me these two times.
Two of the chiefs I have hit, Menelaus and
Diomed, and from each have seen the red blood
flow, yet have I not harmed them.  Surely, if
ever I return safe to my home, I will break this
useless bow."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Æneas, "talk not thus.  Climb into
my chariot, and see what horses we have in Troy.
They will carry us safe to the city, even should
Diomed prevail against us.  Take thou the rein
and the whip, and I will fight; or, if thou wilt,
fight thou, and I will drive."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Pandarus, "let the horses have the
driver whom they know.  It might lose us both,
should we turn to flee, and they linger or start
aside, missing their master's voice."
</p>

<p>
So Pandarus mounted the chariot, and they
drove together against Diomed.  And Sthenelus
saw them coming, and said to his comrades: "I
see two mighty warriors.  It would be well that
we should go back to our chariot."
</p>

<p>
But Diomed frowned, and said: "Talk not of
going back.  Thou wilt talk in vain to me.  As
for my chariot, I care not for it.  As I am will I
go against these men.  Both shall not return safe,
even if one should escape.  But do thou stay my
chariot where it is, tying the reins to the rail;
and if I slay these men, mount the chariot of
Æneas and drive it into the host of the Greeks,
There are no horses under the sun such as these,
for they are of the breed which Zeus himself gave
to King Tros."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Pandarus and Æneas were coming
near, and Pandarus cast his spear.  Right through
the shield of Diomed it passed, and reached the
corselet, and Pandarus cried:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Thou art hit in the loin.  This, methinks, will
lay thee low."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Diomed, "thou hast missed and
not hit at all."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake he threw his spear.  Through
nose and teeth and tongue it passed, and stood
out below the chin.  Headlong from the chariot he
fell, and his armour clashed about him.  Straightway
Æneas leapt off with spear and shield to
guard the body of his friend, and stood as a lion
stands over a carcass.  But Diomed lifted a great
stone, such as two men of our day could scarcely
carry, and cast it.  It struck Æneas on the hip,
crushing the bone.  The hero stooped on his knee,
clutching the ground with his hand, and darkness
covered his eyes.  That hour he would have
perished, but his mother Aphrodite caught him in her
white arms, and threw her veil about him.  But
even so, Diomed was loath to let his foe escape, and
he rushed on her and wounded her on the wrist, and
the blood gushed out&mdash;such blood as flows in the
veins of the immortal gods, who eat not the meat
and drink not the drink of men.  With a loud
shriek she dropped her son, but Apollo caught him
up and covered him with a dark mist, lest perchance
one of the Greeks should spy him and slay him.
</p>

<p>
But Diomed called aloud after Aphrodite:
"Haste thee from the battle, daughter of Zeus.
It is enough for thee to beguile weak women."
</p>

<p>
Wildly did the goddess rush from the battle.
And Iris, swift as the winds, took her by the
hand, and led her out of the press, for she was
tormented with the pain.  She found Ares on the
left of the field, and knelt before him, begging for
his horses with many prayers.  "Help me, dear
brother," she said, "and lend me thy horses to
carry me to Olympus, for I am tormented with a
wound which a mortal man gave me, even Diomed,
who would fight with Father Zeus himself."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
A'-res.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Ares gave her his chariot, and Iris took
the reins, and touched the horses with the whip.
Speedily came they to Olympus, and then Iris
reined in the horses, and Aphrodite fell on the
lap of her mother Dione, who took her daughter
in her arms, and caressed her, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dear child, which of the immortals hath
harmed thee thus?"
</p>

<p>
Aphrodite answered, "No immortal hath done
it, but a mortal man, even Diomed, who now
fighteth with the immortal gods."
</p>

<p>
But Dione answered: "Bear up and endure
thy pain, for many who dwell in Olympus have
suffered pain at the hands of mortal men."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Di-o'-ne.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So spake she, and wiped the moisture from the
wound with both her hands, and the grievous hurt
was healed.  But Hera and Athene looked on and
mocked.  And Athene said to Zeus, "Now hath
thy daughter been moving one of the Greek women
to follow the Trojans whom she loveth so well, and
lo! she hath wounded her hand with the pin of
a golden brooch."
</p>

<p>
But the father smiled, and called Aphrodite to
him, and said, "My child, deeds of war are not
for thee, but love and marriage; leave the rest
to Athene and Ares."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Diomed sprang upon Æneas, though
he knew that Apollo himself held him.  He
regarded not the god, for he was eager to slay the
hero and to strip off his arms.  Thrice he sprang,
and thrice Apollo dashed back his shining shield.
The fourth time Apollo warned him with awful
words, "Beware, Diomed, and fall back, nor
think to match thyself with gods."  But Apollo
carried Æneas out of the battle, and laid him down
in his own temple in the citadel of Troy, and there
he was healed of his wound.  And all the while
the Trojans and the Greeks were fighting, as they
thought, about his body, for Apollo had made a
likeness of the hero and thrown it down in their
midst.  Then Sarpedon spake to Hector with
bitter words:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Sar-pe'-don.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Where are thy boasts, Hector?  Thou saidst
that thou couldst guard thy city, without thy
people or thy allies, thou alone, with thy brothers
and thy brothers-in-law.  But I cannot see even
one of them.  They go and hide themselves, as
dogs before a lion.  It is we, your allies, who
maintain the battle.  I have come from far to help
thy people, nor do I shrink from the fight, but
thou shouldst do thy part."
</p>

<p>
And the words stung Hector to the heart.  He
leapt from his chariot and went through the host,
urging them to the battle.  And on the other side
the Greeks strengthened themselves.  But Ares
brought back Æneas whole from his wound, and
gave him courage and might.  Right glad were
his comrades to see him, nor did they ask him any
question; scant leisure was there for questions
that day.  Then were done many valiant deeds
nor did any bear himself more bravely than Æneas.
</p>

<p>
But all the while Hector, with Ares at his side,
dealt death and destruction through the ranks of
the Greeks.  Hera and Athene saw him where
they sat on the top of Olympus, and were wroth.
So they went to Father Zeus, and prayed that it
might be lawful to them to stop him in his fury.
And Zeus said, "Be it as you will."  So they
yoked the horses to the chariot of Hera and passed
down to earth, the horses flying at every stride
over so much space as a man sees who sits upon
a cliff and looks across the sea to where it meets
the sky.  They alighted on the spot where the
two rivers join their streams.  There they loosed
the horses from the yoke, and then sped like doves
to where the bravest of the Greeks stood round
King Diomed.  There Hera took the shape of
Stentor with the lungs of bronze, whose voice was
as the voice of fifty men, and cried: "Shame, men
of Greece!  When Achilles went to the battle,
the men of Troy came not beyond the gates, but
now they fight far from the city, even by the
ships."  But Athene went to Diomed, where he
stood wiping away the blood from the wound
where Pandarus had struck him with the arrow.
And she spake: "Surely the son of Tydeus is
little like to his sire.  Small of stature was he,
but a keen fighter.  But thou&mdash;whether it be
weariness or fear that keeps thee back I know
not&mdash;canst scarcely be a true son of Tydeus."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Ty'-deus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Diomed answered: "Nay, great goddess,
for I know thee who thou art, daughter of Zeus,
it is not weariness or fear that keeps me back.
'Tis thy own command that I heed.  Thou didst
bid me fight with none other of the immortal gods
but only with Aphrodite, should she come to the
battle.  Therefore I give place, for I see Ares
lording it through the ranks of war."
</p>

<p>
Then Athene spake: "Heed not Ares; drive
thy chariot at him, and smite him with the spear.
This very morning he promised that he would
help the Greeks, and now he hath changed his
purpose."
</p>

<p>
And as she spake she pushed Sthenelus, who
drove the chariot, so that he leapt out upon the
ground, and she mounted herself and caught the
reins and lashed the horses.  But Athene had
donned the helmet of Hades, which whosoever
puts on straightway becomes invisible, for she
would not that Ares should see who she was.
The god saw Diomed come near, and cast his
spear over the yoke of the chariot, eager to slay
the hero.  But Athene caught the spear in her
hand, and turned it aside, so that it flew vainly
through the air.  Then Diomed in turn thrust
forward his spear, and Athene leant upon it, so
that it pierced the loin of Ares, where his girdle
was clasped.  And Ares shouted with the pain, loud
as a host of men, thousands nine or ten, shouts
when it joins in battle.  And the Greeks and
Trojans trembled as they heard.  And Diomed
saw the god go up to Olympus as a thunder-cloud
goes up when the wind of the south blows hot.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
By the side of Zeus did he sit down, and showed
the immortal blood as it flowed from the wound,
and cried: "Father Zeus, canst thou contain
thyself, seeing such deeds as these?  See now this
daughter of thine, how she is bent on evil and
mischief.  All we that dwell in Olympus are
obedient to thee; but her thou checkest not with
word or deed.  And now she hath set on this bold
Diomed to wreak his madness on the immortal
gods: first he wounded Aphrodite on the wrist;
then he rushed on me; my swift feet bare me
away, else surely I had suffered the pains of death
among the carcasses of the slain."
</p>

<p>
But Zeus frowned on him, and spake: "Come
not to me with thy complaints, for of all the
Olympian gods thou vexest me the most, for battle and
strife are ever dear to thee.  'Tis thy mother Hera
that hath put thee to this pain.  Yet I may not
suffer thee to endure the anguish any more, for
thou art my child."
</p>

<p>
Then Zeus called Pæon the healer, and bade
him tend the wound; and he cured it of its smart.
Then Hebe gave to Ares the bath, and clad him in
fair array, and he sat down by Zeus, rejoicing.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
GLAUCUS AND DIOMED
</h3>

<p>
Now when Ares had departed, the Greeks prevailed
again, slaying many of the sons of Troy
and of their allies.  But at last Helenus, the wise
seer, spake to Hector and Æneas:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Glau'-cus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hel'-e-nus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Cause the army to draw back to the walls, and
go through the ranks and give them such strength
and courage as ye may.  And do thou, Hector,
when thou hast so done, pass into the city, and
bid thy mother go with the daughters of Troy,
and take the costliest robe that she hath, and lay
it on the knees of Athene in her temple, vowing
therewith to sacrifice twelve heifers, if perchance
she may have pity upon us, and keep this Diomed
from our walls.  Surely there is no Greek so
strong as he; we did not fear even Achilles' self
so much as we fear this man to-day, so dreadful
is he and fierce.  Go, and we will make such stand
meanwhile as we can."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector passed through the ranks, bidding
them be of good heart, and so departed to the city.
</p>

<p>
And when he was gone, Glaucus and Diomed met
in the space between the two hosts.  Then first
spake Diomed: "Tell me, thou mighty man of
valour, who thou art of mortal men, for never
before have I seen thee in the battle; but now thou
comest out far before the ranks of thy fellows,
and art willing to abide my spear.  If thou be one
of the immortal gods, and hast come down from
heaven, I fight thee not.  I dare not match
myself with the gods of heaven."
</p>

<p>
To him Glaucus made answer: "Valiant son
of Tydeus, why seekest thou to know my name
and lineage, and the generations of my fathers?
For the generations of men are as the leaves
of the wood.  The wind scattereth them on the
ground, and the wood bringeth forth others in
the springtime.  So is it with the generations of
men&mdash;one goeth, and another cometh.  Yet, if
thou wilt know these things, hearken unto me.  I
am the son of Hippolochus, the son of Bellerophon."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Hip-pol'-o-chus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bel-ler'-o-phon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So spake Glaucus, and Diomed was glad at
heart.  His spear he drave into the earth, and
he spake pleasant words to the prince: "Verily,
thou art by inheritance a friend of my house.
For long ago great Œneus entertained Bellerophon
in his dwelling, keeping him twenty days.
Goodly gifts did they give one to the other.
Œneus gave to Bellerophon a belt richly
broidered with purple, and Bellerophon gave to
Œneus a cup of gold with a mouth on either side.
This I left when I came hither, in my palace at
home.  Now Œneus was my grandfather.  Therefore,
I am thy friend and host when thou comest
to the land of Argos, and thou art mine if any
chance shall bring me to Lycia.  But now, let
each of us shun the spear of the other, yea, in the
closest press of the battle.  Many sons of Troy
there are, and many of their brave allies, whom I
may slay if the gods deliver them into my hands,
so and my feet be swift to overtake them.  And
thou also hast many Greeks to slay if thou canst.
But now let us make exchange of arms and
armour, that both the Greeks and the men of Troy
may know that we are friends by inheritance."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Œ'-neus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lyc'-i-a.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So spake Tydeus.  And the two chiefs leapt
down from their chariots, and clasped each the
hand of the other, and pledged their faith.  Then
Zeus changed the wisdom of Glaucus to folly, so
that he gave his armour in exchange for the
armour of Diomed, gold for bronze, the price of
five-score oxen for the price of nine.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE
</h3>

<p>
Hector came into the city by the Scæan gates,
and as he went wives and mothers crowded about
him, asking how it had fared with their husbands
and sons.  But he said naught, save to bid them
pray; and indeed there was sore news for many,
if he had told that which he knew.  Then he
came to the palace of King Priam, and there he
saw Hecuba, his mother, and with her Laodice,
fairest of her daughters.  She caught him by the
hand and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
An-drom'-a-che.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Scæ'-an.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hec'-u-ba.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Why hast thou come from the battle, my son?
Do the Greeks press thee hard, and art thou
minded to pray to Father Zeus from the citadel?
Let me bring thee honey-sweet wine, that thou
mayest pour out before him, aye, and that thou
mayest drink thyself, and gladden thy heart."
</p>

<p>
But Hector said: "Give me not wine, my
mother, lest thou weaken my knees and make
me forget my courage.  Nor must I pour out
an offering to Zeus thus, with unwashed hands.
But do thou gather the mothers of Troy together,
and go to the temple of Athene and take a robe,
the one that is the most precious and beautiful
in thy stores, and lay it on the knees of the
goddess, and pray her to keep this dreadful Diomed
from the walls of Troy; and forget not to vow
therewith twelve heifers as a sacrifice.  As for me,
I will go and seek Paris, if perchance he will come
with me to the war.  Would that the earth might
open and swallow him up, for of a truth he is a
curse to King Priam and to Troy."
</p>

<p>
Then went Queen Hecuba into her house, and
gave command to her maids that they should
assemble the aged women of the city.  Afterwards
she went to her store-chamber, where lay the
well-wrought robes, work of Sidonian women, which
Paris himself brought from Sidon, when he sailed
upon the broad sea, bringing home with him high-born
Helen.  The fairest robe of all did the Queen
take.  Bright as a star it was, and it lay the
undermost of all.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Si-do'-ni-an.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Si'-don.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And when she and the aged women that were
with her came to the temple of Athene that was
in the citadel, the priestess of Athene opened
the doors to them.  They lifted their hands, and
cried aloud, and the priestess laid the garment on
the knees of the goddess, and spake, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Lady Athene, that keepest the city, break now
the spear of Diomed, and let him fall upon his
face before the Scæan gates.  So will we sacrifice
to thee twelve heifers that have not felt the goad,
if only thou wilt have pity upon our town, and on
the wives and little ones of the men of Troy."
</p>

<p>
So she prayed, but Athene heeded not her words.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Hector went to the house of Paris,
where it stood on the citadel, near to his own
dwelling and the dwelling of Priam.  He found
him busy with his arms, and the fair Helen sat
near him and gave their tasks to her maidens.
</p>

<p>
When Hector saw his brother, he spake to him
bitter words, taunting him, as if it were by reason
of his anger that he stood aloof from the battle.
"Verily thou doest not well to be angry.  The
people perish about the walls, and the war burns
hot round the city; and all for thy sake.  Rouse
thee, lest it be consumed."
</p>

<p>
And Paris answered: "Brother, thou hast
spoken well.  It was not in wrath that I sat here.
I was vexed at my sore defeat.  But now my wife
has urged me to join the battle; and truly it is
well, for victory comes now to one and now to
another.  Wait thou, then, till I put on my arms,
or, if thou wouldst depart, I will overtake thee."
</p>

<p>
Then spake Helen with soothing words: "O
my brother, come in, sit thee down in this chair,
for my heart is weary because of my sin and of
the sin of my husband.  Verily Zeus hath ordained
for us an evil fate, so that our story shall
be sung in days that are yet to come."
</p>

<p>
But Hector said: "Ask me not to rest, for I
am eager to help the men of Troy, for verily their
need is sore.  But do thou urge thy husband that
he overtake me while I am yet within the city, for
now I go to my home that I may see my wife and
my little son, because I know not whether I shall
return to them again."
</p>

<p>
So Hector departed and went to his own home,
seeking his wife Andromache, but found her not,
for she was on a tower of the wall with her child
and her child's nurse, weeping sore for fear.  And
Hector spake to the maids:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, whither went the white-armed
Andromache; to see some sister-in-law, or to the
temple of Athene with the mothers of Troy?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said an aged woman, keeper of the
house.  "She went to one of the towers of the
wall, for she had heard that the Greeks were
pressing our people hard.  She hasted as if she
were mad, and the nurse carried the child."
</p>

<p>
So Hector ran through the city to the Scæan
gates, and there Andromache spied him, and
hasted to meet him.  And with her was the nurse,
bearing the young child on her bosom&mdash;Hector's
only child, beautiful, headed as a star.  His father
called him Scamandrius, after the river, but the
sons of Troy called him Astyanax, the "City-King,"
because it was his father who saved the
city.  Silently he smiled when he saw the child,
but Andromache clasped his hand and wept, and
said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Sca-man'-dri-us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As-ty'-a-nax.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"O Hector, thy courage will bring thee to
death.  Thou hast no pity on thy wife and child,
but sparest not thyself, and all the Greeks will
rush on thee and slay thee.  It were better for
me, losing thee, to die; for I have no comfort
but thee.  My father is dead, for Achilles slew
him.  Seven brethren I had, and they all fell in
one day by the hand of the great Achilles.  And
my mother, she is dead, for when she had been
ransomed, Artemis smote her with an arrow in her
father's house.  But thou art father to me, and
mother, and brother, and husband also.  Have
pity, then, and stay here upon the wall, lest thou
leave me a widow and thy child an orphan.  And
set the people here in array by this fig tree, where
the city is easiest to be taken; for there come the
bravest of the Greeks."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Ar'-te-mis.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Hector said: "Nay, let these things be my
care.  I would not that any son or daughter of
Troy should see me skulking from the war.  And
my own heart loathes the thought, and bids me
fight in the front.  Well I know, indeed, that
Priam, and the people of Priam, and holy Troy,
will perish.  Yet it is not for Troy, or for the
people, or even for my father or my mother that I
care so much, as for thee in the day when some
Greek shall carry thee away captive, and thou
shalt ply the loom or carry the pitcher in the land
of Greece.  And some one shall say when he sees
thee, 'This was Hector's wife, who was the bravest
of the sons of Troy.'  May the earth cover me
before that day!"
</p>

<p>
Then Hector stretched out his arms to his child.
But the child drew back into the bosom of his
nurse, with a loud cry, fearing the shining bronze
and the horse-hair plume which nodded awfully
from his helmet top.  Then father and mother
laughed aloud.  And Hector took the helmet from
his head, and laid it on the ground, and caught
his child in his hands, and kissed him and dandled
him, praying aloud to Father Zeus and all the gods.
</p>

<p>
"Grant, Father Zeus and all ye gods, that this
child may be as I am, great among the sons of
Troy; and may they say some day, when they see
him carrying home the bloody spoils from the war.
'A better man than his father, this,' and his
mother shall be glad at heart."
</p>

<p>
Then he gave the child to his mother, and she
clasped him to her breast, and smiled a tearful
smile.  And her husband's heart was moved; and
he stroked her with his hand, and spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Be not troubled over much.  No man shall
slay me against the ordering of fate; but as for
fate, that, methinks, no man may escape, be he
coward or brave.  But go, ply thy tasks, the
shuttle and the loom, and give their tasks to thy
maidens, and let men take thought for the battle."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector took up his helmet from the
ground, and Andromache went her way to her
home, oft turning back her eyes.  And when she
was come, she and all her maidens wailed for the
living Hector as though he were dead, for she
thought that she should never see him any more
returning safe from the battle.
</p>

<p>
And as Hector went his way, Paris came running,
clad in shining arms, like to some proud
steed which has been fed high in his stall, and
now scours the plain with head aloft and mane
streaming over his shoulders.  And he spake to
Hector:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have kept thee, I fear, when thou wast in
haste, nor came at thy bidding."
</p>

<p>
But Hector answered: "No man can blame thy
courage, only thou wilfully heldest back from
the battle.  Therefore do the sons of Troy speak
shame of thee.  But now let us go to the war."
</p>

<p>
So they went together out of the gates, and fell
upon the hosts of the Greeks and slew many chiefs
of fame, and Glaucus the Lycian went with them.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE DUEL OF HECTOR AND AJAX
</h3>

<p>
Now when Athene saw that the Greeks were
perishing by the hand of Hector and his
companions, it grieved her sore.  So she came down
from the heights of Olympus to help them.  And
Apollo met her and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Art thou come, Athene, to help the Greeks
whom thou lovest?  Well, let us stay the battle
for this day; hereafter they shall fight till the
doom of Troy be accomplished."
</p>

<p>
But Athene answered, "How shall we stay it?"
</p>

<p>
And Apollo said, "We will set on Hector to
challenge the bravest of the Greeks to fight with
him, man to man."
</p>

<p>
So they two put the matter into the mind of
Helenus the seer.  Then Helenus went near to
Hector, and spake, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, for I am thy brother,.  Cause
the rest of the sons of Troy and of the Greeks to
sit down, and do thou challenge the bravest of the
Greeks to fight with thee, man to man.  And be
sure thou shalt not fall in the battle, for the will
of the immortal gods is so."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector greatly rejoiced, and passed to the
front of the army, holding his spear by the middle,
and kept back the sons of Troy; and King
Agamemnon did likewise with his own people.  Then
Hector spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hear me, sons of Troy, and ye men of Greece.
The covenant that we made one with another hath
been broken, for Zeus would have it so, purposing
evil to both, till either you shall take our
high-walled city or we shall conquer you by your ships.
But let one of you, who call yourselves champions
of the Greeks, come forth and fight with me, man
to man.  And let it so be that if he vanquish me,
he shall spoil me of my arms, but give my body to
my people, that they may burn it with fire; and
if I vanquish him, I will spoil him of his arms, but
give his body to the Greeks, that they may bury
him and raise a great mound above him by the
broad salt river of Hellespont.  And so men of
after days shall see it, sailing by, and say, 'This is
the tomb of the bravest of the Greeks, whom Hector
slew.'  So shall my name live forever."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Hel'-les-pont.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But all the Greeks kept silence, fearing to meet
him in battle, but ashamed to hold back.  At last
Menelaus leapt forward and spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Surely ye are women and not men.  Is there
no man to stand up against this Hector?  Lo!  I
will fight with him my own self."
</p>

<p>
So he spake in his rage, courting death, for
Hector was much stronger than he.  Then King
Agamemnon answered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Nay, but this is folly, my brother.  Seek not
in thy anger to fight with one that is stronger
than thou; for even Achilles is loth to meet
Hector.  Sit thou down among thy comrades, and the
Greeks will find some champion who shall fight
with him."
</p>

<p>
And Menelaus hearkened to his brother's words,
and sat down.  Then rose up nine chiefs of fame.
First of all, King Agamemnon, lord of many
nations, and next to him Diomed, son of Tydeus,
and Ajax the Greater, and Ajax the Less, and
then Idomeneus, and Meriones, who was his
companion in arms, and Eurypylus, and Thoas, son of
Andræmon, and the wise Ulysses.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Me-ri'-o-nes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Eu-ryp'-y-lus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tho'-as.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  An-dræ'-mon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Nestor said, "Let us cast lots to see who
shall do battle with the mighty Hector."
</p>

<p>
So they threw the lots into the helmet of King
Agamemnon,&mdash;a lot for each.  And the people
prayed, "Grant, ye gods, that the lot of Ajax the
Greater may leap forth, or the lot of Diomed, or
the lot of King Agamemnon."  Then Nestor shook
the lots in the helmet, and the one which they
most wished leapt forth.  For the herald took it
through the ranks and showed it to the chiefs, but
none knew it for his own till he came to where
Ajax the Greater stood among his comrades.  But
Ajax had marked it with his mark, and put forth
his hand for it, and claimed it, right glad at heart.
On the ground by his feet he threw it, and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mine is the lot, my friends, and right glad I
am, for I think that I shall prevail over the mighty
Hector."
</p>

<p>
So he armed himself and moved forwards,
smiling with grim face.  With mighty strides he
came, brandishing his long-shafted spear.  And
all the Greeks were glad to behold him, but the
knees of the Trojans were loosened with fear, and
great Hector's heart beat fast; but he trembled
not, nor gave place, seeing that he had himself
called him to battle.  So Ajax came near, holding
before him the great shield, like a wall.  Seven
folds of bull's hide it had, and an eighth of bronze.
Threateningly he spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now shalt thou know, Hector, what manner
of men there are yet among our chiefs, though
Achilles the lion-hearted is far away, sitting idly
in his tent, in great wrath with King Agamemnon.
Do thou, then, begin the battle."
</p>

<p>
"Speak not to me," said Hector, "as though I
were a woman or a child, knowing nothing of war.
Well I know all the arts of battle, to ply my
shield this way and that, to guide my car through
the tumult of steeds, and to stand fighting hand
to hand."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake he hurled his long-shafted
spear, and smote the great shield.  Through six
folds it passed, but in the seventh it was stayed.
Then Ajax hurled his spear, striking Hector's
shield.  Through shield it passed and corselet,
and cut the tunic close against the loin; but
Hector shrank away and escaped the doom of death.
Then, each with a fresh spear, they rushed
together like lions or wild boars of the wood.  First
Hector smote the middle of the shield of Ajax,
but pierced it not, for the spear-point was bent
back; then Ajax, with a great bound, drove his
spear at Hector's shield and pierced it, forcing him
back, and grazing his neck so that the black blood
welled out.  Yet did not Hector cease from the
combat.  A great stone and rough he caught up
from the ground, and hurled it at the seven-fold
shield.  Loud rang the bronze, but the shield
brake not.  Then Ajax took a stone heavier by
far, and threw it with all his might.  It brake the
shield of Hector, and bore him backwards, so that
he fell at length with his shield above him.  But
Apollo raised him up.  Then did both draw
their swords; but ere they could join in close
battle came the heralds, and held their sceptres
between them, and Idæus, the herald of Troy,
spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
I-dæ'-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Fight no more, my sons; Zeus loves you both,
and ye are both mighty warriors.  That we all
know right well.  But now the night bids you
cease, and it is well to heed its bidding."
</p>

<p>
Then said Ajax: "It is for Hector to speak, for
he called the bravest of the Greeks to battle.
And as he wills it, so will I."
</p>

<p>
And Hector said: "O Ajax, the gods have
given thee stature and strength and skill, nor is
there any better warrior among the Greeks.  Let
us cease then from the battle; we may yet meet
again, and the gods give the victory to me or thee.
But now let us give gifts the one to the other, so
that Trojans and Greeks may say, 'Hector and
Ajax met in fierce fight and parted in friendship.'"
</p>

<p>
So Hector gave to Ajax a silver-studded sword
with the scabbard and the sword-belt, and Ajax
gave to Hector a buckler splendid with purple.
So they parted.  Right glad were the sons of
Troy when they saw Hector returning safe.  Glad
also were the Greeks, as they led Ajax rejoicing
in his victory to King Agamemnon.  Thereupon
the King called the chiefs to banquet together,
and bade slay an ox of five years old, and Ajax he
honoured most of all, giving him the best portions.
And when the feast was ended, Nestor said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It were well that we should cease a while from
war and burn the dead, for many are fallen.  And
we will build a great wall and dig a trench about
it, and we will make gates that a chariot may pass
through, so that our ships may be safe, if the sons
of Troy should press us hard."
</p>

<p>
But the next morning came a herald from Troy
to the chiefs, as they sat in council by the ship of
King Agamemnon, and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"This is the word of Priam and the men of Troy:
Paris will give back all the treasures of the fair
Helen, and many more besides; but the fair Helen
herself he will not give.  And if this please you
not, grant us a truce, that we may bury our dead."
</p>

<p>
Then Diomed spake, "Nay, we will not take the
treasures, for a man may know, even though he be
a fool, that the doom of Troy is come."
</p>

<p>
And King Agamemnon said, "Herald, thou hast
heard the word of the Greeks, but as for the truce,
be it as you will."
</p>

<p>
So the next day they burnt their dead, and the
Greeks made a wall with gates and dug a trench
about it.  And when it was finished, even at
sunset, they made ready a meal, and lo! there came
ships from Lemnos bringing wine, and Greeks
bought thereof, some with bronze, and some with
iron, and some with shields of ox hide.  All night
they feasted right joyously.  The sons of Troy
also feasted in their city.  But the dreadful
thunder rolled through the night, for Zeus was
planning evil against them.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE BATTLE ON THE PLAIN
</h3>

<p>
When the next morning came Zeus called the
gods to an assembly on the topmost ridge of
Olympus, and spake to them, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hearken, gods and goddesses!  Let none of
you presume to go against my word.  Whosoever
of you shall aid either Greek or Trojan, him will
I smite with the thunder, or else will cast him far
down to the darkness of Tartarus, whose gates are
iron and whose threshold bronze, and he shall
know that I am chief among gods.  And if ye will
make trial of my strength, let down a chain of gold
from heaven to earth, and take hold thereof, all
ye gods and goddesses.  Yet shall ye not drag
down Zeus, no, though ye strive with all your
might.  But if I should draw with all my strength,
I could lift you up, and earth and sea with you,
and bind the chain about a horn of Olympus, and
leave you hanging there.  So much am I stronger
than all besides."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Tar'-tar-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then all the gods sat silent and amazed.  But
at last spake Athene: "Surely we know, Father
Zeus, that thy strength cannot be resisted.  Yet
we pity the Greeks, and fear lest they should
perish altogether.  We will keep aloof from the
war, according to thy command, but we will give
them counsel."
</p>

<p>
And Zeus smiled upon her, and gave consent.
Then he yoked to his chariot his swift horses, and
touched them with his whip.  Midway between
heaven and earth they flew, and came to Ida, the
mountain of many springs.  There he stayed his
course, and sat down amidst the peaks, looking on
the city of Troy and the host of the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks took their meal in haste, and armed
themselves.  The men of Troy also made them
ready for battle in the city; fewer they were in
number than their foes, but not less eager for the
fight, for indeed a sore need was upon them,
the need to fight for children and wife.  Then
the gates were opened, and the people went quickly
forth.
</p>

<p>
And the two hosts came together, buckler
against buckler, and spear against spear, and the
shields clashed with a great ringing sound.  While
the day was increasing, neither this side prevailed
nor that; but at noon Father Zeus stretched on
high his golden scales, laying in them two weights
of death; one for the Greeks, and one for the
sons of Troy.  By the middle he took the scales,
and let them hang, and the scale of the Greeks
sank lower.  Then did he send his blazing thunderbolt
among the people from the heights of Ida,
and they saw it and were dismayed.
</p>

<p>
Then could no man hold his ground.  Only
Nestor remained, against his will, for Paris had
slain one of his chariot-horses with an arrow.
And while the old man cut away the traces,
Hector came through the press.  Then would the old
man have perished, but Diomed was swift to
notice his danger.  With a great cry he called
Ulysses, and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Son of Laertes, whither dost thou flee, turning
thy back like a coward?  See that no man thrust
thee in the back with a spear.  Tarry, and keep
back this fierce man of war from old Nestor."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, but Ulysses heeded not, fleeing
fast to the ships.
</p>

<p>
Then rushed Diomed, alone as he was, into the
foremost rank, and stood before the chariot of old
Nestor, and spake: "Old sir, the younger fighters
press thee sore; feeble thou art, and weak thy
charioteer, and thy horses slow.  Come, mount
upon my chariot, and see what the horses that I
took from Æneas can do&mdash;how they can flee, and
follow, and speed this way and that!  Thy
charioteer and mine shall look to thy horses.  Come
thou with me, and Hector shall see whether there
is yet any strength in the spear of Diomed."
</p>

<p>
To this Nestor gave consent, and took the reins
in his hand, and plied the whip.  Soon they came
near to Hector, and Diomed cast his spear.  Hector
he missed, but smote his charioteer upon the
breast, so that he fell from the chariot, and the
swift horses started back.  Hector's heart was
dark with grief for his comrade; yet he let him
lie where he fell, for he must needs find another
charioteer.
</p>

<p>
Then there would have been rout among the
men of Troy, and they would have been pent up
in the city, as sheep in a fold, but that Zeus
hurled a blazing thunderbolt.  Right before the
chariot of Diomed did it fall; and the horses
crouched in fear, and Nestor let fall the reins
from his hands, for he was sore afraid, and cried
aloud:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Son of Tydeus, turn thy horses to flight; seest
thou that Zeus is not with thee?  To-day he
giveth glory to Hector; to-morrow, perhaps, to
thee.  The purpose of Zeus none may hinder."
</p>

<p>
Then the son of Tydeus spake: "Old sir, thou
sayest well; but this goeth to my heart, that
Hector will say, 'Diomed fled before me, seeking
the ships.'  Then may the earth swallow me up!"
</p>

<p>
But Nestor made reply, "Though Hector call
thee coward, yet will not the sons of Troy believe
him, nor the daughters whose gallant husbands
thou hast tumbled in the dust."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned his horses, and fled.  But
Hector cried after Diomed: "Art thou the man to
whom the Greeks give high place in the feast, and
plenteous cups of wine?  Not so will they honour
thee hereafter.  Run, girl! run, coward!  Shalt
thou climb our walls, and carry away our daughters
in thy ships?"
</p>

<p>
Then Diomed was very wroth, doubting whether
to flee or to turn; but when he turned Zeus
thundered from on high, making him afraid.  And
Hector bade the hosts of Troy be of good courage,
for that Zeus was with them, and called to his
horses: "Come, now, Bayard, and Whitefoot, and
Flame of Fire, and Brilliant; forget not how the
fair Andromache has cared for you; aye, even
before me, who am her husband.  Carry me fast,
that I may win old Nestor's shield, which men
say is all of gold, and strip from the shoulders
of Diomed the breastplate which Hephæstus
wrought."
</p>

<p>
So the Greeks fled headlong within the wall
which they had built, Hector driving them before
him, and all the space between the wall and the
ships was crowded with chariots and with men.
Then would Hector have burned the ships, had
not Hera put it in the heart of King Agamemnon
to urge the Greeks to battle.  On the ship of
Ulysses, that was midmost of all, he stood, so that
he could shout to either end, to where Ajax the
Greater on one side, and Achilles on the other,
had drawn up their ships.  And he cried aloud:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Shame on you, ye Greeks!  Where are now
your boasts that one man of you would outmatch
five score, yea, ten score, of the sons of Troy?
And now one single man is of more worth than
you all!  O Father Zeus, grant us that we may
at least escape with our lives."
</p>

<p>
And Zeus hearkened to his prayer, and sent a
sign from heaven, an eagle that held a kid in his
claw; by the altar of Zeus did he drop it, and the
Greeks, when they saw it, took heart, and leaped
upon the men of Troy, and rejoiced again in the
battle.
</p>

<p>
Foremost of all was Diomed.  After him came
the sons of Atreus, and either Ajax, and all
the chiefs, and among them Teucer, who stood
beneath the shield of Ajax son of Telamon, as
he bent his bow.  Ajax would lift his shield a
little, and Teucer, peering out, would shoot a
warrior in the throng.  Then would he go back as a
child to his mother, and Ajax would hide him
beneath his shield.  Eight warriors did he slay; and
when Agamemnon saw him, he came near, and
spake, saying: "Shoot on, Teucer, and be a light
to thy people and to thy father Telamon.  Surely
when Zeus and Athene shall grant me the spoil of
Troy, to thee, first after myself, will I give a
goodly gift."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Teu'-cer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tel'-a-mon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Teucer made reply: "Eight shafts have I
launched, and every shaft has been buried in a
warrior's flesh; but that man I cannot strike."
</p>

<p>
He spake, and sped another arrow from the
string, aiming at Hector.  Him he touched not,
but he slew a son of Priam.  Yet once again
he shot, and slew this time the charioteer of Hector,
striking him full upon the breast, as he rushed
into battle.  Then Hector's heart grew dark with
rage and grief.  He leapt from his chariot to the
ground, and caught a stone in his hand, and went
towards Teucer, desiring to crush him.  Then
Teucer took an arrow from the quiver and fitted
it on the string, but as he drew the arrow to his
shoulder, Hector smote him where the collarbone
stands between neck and breast, and snapped the
bow-string, and numbed his arm and wrist, so that
the bow flew from his hand, and he fell upon his
knee.  But Ajax bestrode him, covering him with
his shield, and two of his comrades bare him,
groaning deeply, to the ships.
</p>

<p>
Then again did Zeus put courage into the hearts
of the men of Troy, and they thrust the Greeks
back to the ditch; and Hector moved ever in
the front, rejoicing in his strength.  Even as a
dog pursues a wild boar or a lion, and catches
him by hip or thigh, so did Hector hang upon
the Greeks, and smite the hindmost as they
fled.
</p>

<p>
But Hera saw and pitied them, and spake to
Athene: "Shall not thou and I have pity on the
Greeks once more?  They are perishing at the
hands of Hector."
</p>

<p>
Athene made reply: "It is all the doing of my
father, who listened to Thetis, when she besought
him to give honour to Achilles.  But another day,
may be, he will hearken unto me.  Make ready,
therefore, the horses, while I arm myself for the
war.  We will see whether Hector will be glad
when he beholds thee and me in the forefront of
the battle."
</p>

<p>
So Hera made ready the chariot, and Athene
armed herself for the war.  And when she was
armed, Hera lashed the horses, and the great gates
of heaven, where the Hours keep watch, opened
before them.
</p>

<p>
But Zeus saw them from Ida, and said to Iris
of the golden wings: "Go now, swift Iris, bid
these two not come face to face with me, for our
meeting would be ill for them.  Verily I will cast
them from their chariot, and break the chariot in
pieces.  Not for ten years would they recover
of their wounds should the lightning smite them."
</p>

<p>
So Iris hasted on her way, and gave the two
goddesses the Father's message.
</p>

<p>
Then spake Hera to Athene: "No more shall
we two do battle with Zeus for the sake of mortal
men.  Let them perish or live, as it may chance."
</p>

<p>
So they two went back to Olympus, and sat
down in their chairs of gold, among the other
gods, right heavy of heart.
</p>

<p>
Zeus also hastened from Ida to Olympus, and
came into the assembly of the gods; but Hera and
Athene sat apart, and spake not, and asked no
question.
</p>

<p>
Then said Zeus: "Why are ye so cast down?
To-morrow shall see worse things than these;
for great Hector will not cease from his slaying
till the son of Peleus be roused by his ships, in
the day when they shall fight about the dead
Patroclus."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Pe'-leus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And row the sun sank into the sea; wroth
were the Trojans that the light should go, but to
the Greeks welcome came the night.
</p>

<p>
Then Hector called the men of Troy to an
assembly.  In his hand he held a spear eleven
cubits long, with flaming point of bronze, and
circled with gold; on it he leant and spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
cubit, a foot and a half.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Give ear, ye Trojans and allies!  I thought
this day to destroy the hosts of the Greeks and
their ships, and so to return to Troy; but night
hath hindered me.  Let us yield to night, and
take our meal.  Unharness your horses and feed
them.  Fetch also from the city kine, and sheep,
and wine, and bread, and store of fuel also, that
we may burn many fires, lest the Greeks escape
across the sea in the night.  Also let the heralds
make proclamation in the city that the lads and
the old men should guard the wall, and that every
woman should light a great fire in her house, and
that all should keep watch, lest an ambush should
enter the city while the people are away.  In the
morning will we arm ourselves, and wake the war
beside the ships, and bring ruin on the Greeks."
</p>

<p>
So Hector spake, and all the Trojans shouted
their assent.  They loosed their horses, and fetched
food from the city, and gathered fuel.  All night
long they sat in high hope.  And as on some
windless night the stars shine bright about the
moon, and all the crags and dells are shown, and
the tops of the hills also, and the depths of the
sky are open, and all the stars appear, and the
shepherd's heart is glad; so the Trojan fires
glittered between the stream of Xanthus and the
ships.  A thousand fires were burning, and fifty
sat in the glare of each; and the horses stood
beside the chariots champing their grain, and waited
for the morn.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES
</h3>

<p>
While the Trojans watched with good hope,
the Greeks were filled with fear.  And King
Agamemnon was troubled beyond all others.  He bade
the heralds call every man to the assembly.
Gloomily they sat, and when the King rose up to
speak, his tears dropped down, as the waters drop
down a steep cliff-side from some spring which
the sunshine toucheth not.  Thus he spake: "O
friends, lords and leaders of the Greeks, verily
Zeus dealeth ill with me.  Once he promised that
I should take the city of Troy and so return
home; but now he hath deceived me, bidding me
go back dishonoured, having lost much people.
Therefore let us flee with our ships to the land
of our fathers, for Troy we may not take."
</p>

<p>
Long time the chiefs kept silence, for they were
out of heart; but at the last rose Diomed, and
spake: "Be not wroth, O King, if I contend with
this thy madness.  Thou hast called me laggard
and coward; whether I be so indeed the Greeks
know well, both young and old.  But to thee
Zeus hath given lordship and the power of the
sceptre above thy fellows; but courage he hath
not given, and courage is best of all.  Now if
thine heart be bent upon return, go thou; the
way is nigh, and thy ships are by the sea; but all
the other Greeks will abide till they have taken
Troy.  Yea, and if these also will go, then we two,
I and Sthenelus, will abide and fight till we make
an end of the city, for it was the gods that sent us
hither."
</p>

<p>
Then Nestor spake: "Thou art brave in war,
son of Tydeus, and excellent in council above thy
fellows.  But now let us take our meal; and let
sentinels watch along the trench.  And do thou,
son of Atreus, make a feast for thy chiefs, as is
meet.  And him who counsels thee most wisely
thou must follow.  Sorely do we need wise counsel,
seeing that the enemy have so many fires near
our ships.  Verily this night will save our army
or destroy."
</p>

<p>
So King Agamemnon called the chiefs to a
feast; and when the feast was ended Nestor rose
up and spake: "Evil was the day, O King, when
thou didst send and take the damsel Briseis from
the tent of Achilles.  Let us therefore take
thought how we may best appease him with noble
gifts and pleasant words."
</p>

<p>
Then said King Agamemnon: "These are true
words that thou hast spoken, old man.  Truly I
did as a fool that day, and I deny it not.  For he
that is loved of Zeus is of more worth than whole
armies of men; and verily Zeus loveth this man,
seeing that he putteth the Greeks to flight that he
may do him honour.  But even as I wronged him
in my folly, so will I make amends, and give a
recompense beyond all telling.  And now I will
declare before you all the gifts that I will give:
a huge treasure of gold and bronze, and twelve
stout horses, that have won prizes in the race by
fleetness of foot.  And seven women will I give
him, skilled in excellent handiwork, fairer than all
women.  These will I give him, and with them
the damsel Briseis, even as I took her from him.
And if the gods shall grant us to destroy the great
city of Priam, then let him come when we divide
the spoil, and choose for himself twenty women of
Troy, the fairest there be after Helen.  And if he
come again to the land of Greece, then shall he be
my son, and he shall choose in marriage which one
of my daughters he will.  Yea, and I will give
with her seven fair cities, with pasture-lands and
vineyards, wherein dwell men that have many
flocks and herds, who will honour him with gifts
even as men honour a god, and will fulfil his
commands.  All this will I give him, if so be that he
will cease from his anger."
</p>

<p>
To him Nestor made answer: "No man may
think lightly of the gifts that thou givest to great
Achilles.  Come, therefore, let us choose men, that
they may go with all speed to his tent.  Let
Phœnix, who is beloved of Zeus, lead the way; and
let Ajax the Greater and Ulysses go with him,
and two heralds also."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Phœ'-nix.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So the heralds went by the shore of the sea;
and, as they went, they made prayer to the god
that shakes the earth that they might turn the
heart of Achilles.  And when they came to the
ships of the Myrmidons, they found the King
taking his pleasure with a harp.  There he sat,
delighting his soul with music, and sang the deeds
of heroes of old time.  And Patroclus sat opposite
him in silence, waiting till he should cease from
his singing.  Then the two chiefs came forward,
Ulysses leading the way, and stood before the
face of Achilles; and Achilles leapt up in much
amaze, holding the harp in his hand.  And Patroclus
rose also from his seat when he saw the twain.
Then said Achilles, fleet of foot, "Welcome ye
are, and right dear to me, for all my anger."
</p>

<p>
So spake Achilles, and led them forward; and
he bade them sit on seats that were covered with
coverlets of purple.  Then said he to Patroclus,
"Bring forth the biggest bowl, and mix for each
man a cup, for I have not dearer friends than
these that are come beneath my roof this day.
</p>

<p>
And the chiefs stretched forth their hands to
the meat that lay ready before them.  And when
they had done with the desire for food and drink,
Ajax nodded to Phœnix that he should speak;
but Ulysses perceived it, and was beforehand with
him, and filled a cup with wine, and pledged
Achilles, and spake: "Hail, Achilles!  No lack
have we had of feasting before in the tent of King
Agamemnon and now in thine; but it is not of
feasting that we think this day; for we behold
sore destruction close at hand, and are afraid.
Verily, we are in doubt whether or no we may
save our ships, unless thou wilt gird on thy might
again.  For indeed this day the men of Troy and
their allies come near to the ships to burn them
with fire.  And Zeus shows them favourable
signs.  As for Hector, he rages furiously, trusting
in Zeus, and vows that he will burn the ships with
fire, and make havoc of the Greeks while they are
dazed with the smoke of the burning.  Sorely do
I fear in my heart lest the god fulfil his threats,
and doom us to perish here in Troy, far from the
plains of Argos.  Up, therefore, if thou art minded
even now to save the Greeks!  Delay not, lest
thou repent hereafter, for there is no remedy for
that which is done.  Cease from thy anger.
Verily, Agamemnon offereth thee worldly gifts, a
huge treasure of gold and bronze, and twelve
stout horses that have won much wealth for
Agamemnon by fleetness of foot, and seven women,
skilful in handiwork, and fairer than all their
kind; and Briseis herself he will restore to thee,
even as he took her from thee.  All these things
will he give; and if we take the great city of
Priam, twenty daughters of Troy, fairest of
women, after Helen.  And when we shall go back
to Greece, thou shalt have his daughter to wife,
her whom thou shalt choose, and with her seven
cities, lying all of them near to the sea, a land of
vineyards and cornfields, whose folk shall pay
thee tribute and honour.  But if thou yet hate
from thy heart Agamemnon and his gifts, then I
pray thee have pity upon the Greeks, who will
honour thee even as men honour a god.  Hector,
too, thou mayest slay, for he will come near thee
in his madness, for he deems that there is not a
man of all the Greeks that can stand against
him."
</p>

<p>
To him Achilles, fleet of foot, made answer:
"Son of Laertes, plain shall be my speech; for I
would not have you sit before me, seeking to coax
me, one man this way and another another.  Why
must the Greeks make war against the sons of
Troy?  Why did the sons of Atreus gather this
host together, and lead them to this land?  Was
it not for fair-haired Helen's sake?  Tell me,
then, do the sons of Atreus alone of all men love
their wives?  Nay, but whosoever is good and
sound of heart loveth his wife and cherisheth her,
even as I loved mine, though I won her by my
spear.  He took her from me, and deceived me;
let him not make trial of me again, for I know
him well, and he shall not prevail with me.  Let
him take counsel now with thee, Ulysses, and with
the other princes of the host, how he may keep
from the ships the devouring fire.  Many things
hath he done without my help, building a wall
and digging a ditch about it, both wide and deep,
and setting stakes in the ditch; yet for all this
can he not keep Hector from the ships.  And yet,
when I fought in the host of the Greeks, this
Hector dared not set his army in array far from
the walls, but scarce came to the Scæan gates and
the fig tree.  Once did he await me there to do
battle, man against man, and scarce escaped my
spear.  But now, seeing that I have no mind to
fight with him, I will do sacrifice to-morrow to
Zeus and all the gods, and I will store my ships
and launch them on the sea.  Yea, to-morrow,
right early in the morning, thou shalt see them, if
thou wilt, sailing along the Hellespont, and my
men toiling eagerly at the oar; and if the god
that shaketh the earth grants me a fair journey,
on the third morning shall I come to the fair land
of Phthia.  There is all the wealth that I left
behind me when I came to Troy; and hence I shall
carry with me yet more of gold and bronze and
iron, and fair women slaves, my portion of the
spoil.  King Agamemnon shall not deceive me
again with lying speech.  And as for his gifts, I
scorn them; though he give me tenfold, yea,
twentyfold, all that he now hath promised.  Yea,
verily, though he give me gifts as the sand of the
sea for multitude, he shall not persuade me, till
he shall have endured bitterness of soul like
mine.  And his daughter I will not wed&mdash;no,
not though she be as fair as golden Aphrodite,
and match Athene of the flashing eyes in skill of
handiwork.  Let him choose him from among the
Greeks some kinglier son-in-law than I, and for
me, if the gods bring me safe to my home, Peleus
shall choose a wife.  For all the wealth that was
stored in the city of Troy, in the days of peace,
before the Greeks came thither, and all the treasure
that is laid up in the temple of Apollo the
Archer that is in the city of Delphi&mdash;all this I
count as nothing in comparison with life.  For a
man may take cattle and sheep for spoil, and he
may buy treasure and horses; but the life of a
man, when it hath once passed from out his lips,
he may not win back by spoiling or by buying.
And to me my mother, even Thetis, the goddess
of the silver foot, hath unfolded my doom.  A
double doom it is.  If I abide in this land and
fight against the city of Troy, then shall I return
no more to my native country, but my name shall
live for ever; but if I go back to my home, then
my fame shall be taken from me, but I shall live
long and see not the grave.  Therefore I go, and
verily I counsel you all to go, for Troy ye never
shall take as ye desire, seeing that Zeus, who seeth
all things before, holdeth over it his hand, and
her sons are a valiant folk.  And now go your
way; carry back this answer to the princes of the
Greeks.  But let the old man Phœnix abide with
me in my tent to-night, that he may sail in my
ship on the morrow.  Verily he shall sail, if he
will; but I will not take him by force."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Phthi'-a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pe'-leus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Thus spake Achilles.  And the chiefs sat still
and held their peace, marvelling at his speech, so
vehement was he.  But at the last the old man
Phœnix made answer.  With many tears he spake,
for he was sore afraid lest the ships of the Greeks
should perish: "If indeed thou art minded to
depart, and carest not to save the ships from
devouring fire, how can I endure to be left alone by
thee?  For the old man Peleus made me thy
teacher, both of words and of deeds.  With no
man but me wouldst thou go unto the feast, or
take thy meat in the hall; but I set thee upon my
knees, and cut the savoury morsel for thee from
the dish, and put the wine-cup to thy lips.  Many
a tunic hast thou stained for me, sputtering forth
the wine upon it.  Much have I suffered, and
much toiled for thee; for child of mine own I had
not, and thou wast to me as a son, Achilles, to
cherish me in my need."
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles nodded to Patroclus, that he
should spread a couch for the old man Phœnix,
that so the other twain might depart without
delay.  Then said Ajax, the son of Telamon:
"Let us depart, Ulysses.  I trow that we shall
accomplish naught this day.  Let us, therefore,
take back the tidings, evil though they be, to them
that wait for us."
</p>

<p>
Then said Achilles: "My heart swells with
wrath, when I remember how the son of Atreus
shamed me before all the people, as though I was
some stranger nothing worth.  Go and take my
message.  I will not arise to the battle till Hector
shall come as he slays the Greeks even to the tents
of the Myrmidons, and shall encircle their ships
with fire.  But when he shall come to my tent
and to my ships, then I ween shall he be stayed,
for all that he is eager for battle."
</p>

<p>
Then Ajax and Ulysses departed, and told the
message of Achilles to King Agamemnon.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE ADVENTURE OF ULYSSES AND DIOMED
</h3>

<p>
The other chiefs of the Greeks slept that night;
but King Agamemnon slept not; sore troubled
was he in heart.  For when he looked towards
Troy, and saw the many fires, and heard the sound
of flute and pipe and the murmur of men, he was
astonished; and when he looked towards the ships
he groaned, and tore his hair, thinking what evil
might come to the people.  Then it seemed good
to him to seek counsel from Nestor.  So he arose,
and drew his coat about his breast, and bound the
sandals on his feet, and wrapped a tawny lion's
hide about him, and took a spear in his hand.
</p>

<p>
To Menelaus also came no sleep that night.  So
he arose, and wrapped a leopard's skin about
him, and put on his head a cap of bronze, and
took a spear in his hand, and went to seek his
brother.
</p>

<p>
He found him arming by his ship, and said;
"Why armest thou?  Wilt thou send some one to
spy out the doings of the Trojans?  I fear much
that no man will undertake the task to go alone,
for it is a daring deed."
</p>

<p>
To him replied King Agamemnon: "We have
need of good counsel, my brother, that we may
save the people.  Truly the mind of Zeus is
changed; for never hath a man wrought such
destruction in one day as did Hector on the
Greeks.  Run thou to Ajax and Idomeneus, and
call them to the council, and I will go to Nestor."
</p>

<p>
So the chiefs were gathered to the council.
First of all they went to the company of them
that watched the camp.  These they found not
sleeping but awake.  As dogs that hear the sound
of some wild beast in the wood, so did the watch
look towards the plain, thinking to hear the sound
of the feet of the Trojans.
</p>

<p>
Gladly did old Nestor see them, and spake, saying,
"Such be your watch, my children, lest we
become a prey to our enemies."
</p>

<p>
Then he hasted to cross the trench, and with
him went the other princes.  In an open spaces
that was clear of dead, they sat down, even where
Hector had turned back from slaying the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
And Nestor rose and said: "Is there now a
man who will go among the sons of Troy, and see
what they are minded to do?  Great honour will
he win, and gifts."
</p>

<p>
Then Diomed said, "I am ready to go, but I
would fain have some one with me.  To have a
companion gives comfort and courage, and, indeed,
two wits are better than one to take counsel and
to foresee."
</p>

<p>
And many were willing to go with Diomed.
But Agamemnon said, "Choose the best man, O
Diomed, and regard not the birth or rank of
any."  And Diomed answered: "If I may choose, whom
should I choose rather than the wise Ulysses?
Brave is he, and prudent, and Athene loves him
well."
</p>

<p>
But Ulysses said: "Praise me not overmuch,
nor blame me.  Only let us go, for the night is
far spent."
</p>

<p>
So these two armed themselves.  Diomed took
a two-edged sword and a shield, and a helmet
without a crest, and Ulysses a bow and a quiver
and a sword, and a helmet of hide with the white
teeth of a wild boar about it.  Then both prayed
to Athene that she would help them, and after
that they went through the darkness like two
lions, trampling over dead bodies and arms and
blood.
</p>

<p>
But Hector, meanwhile, was thinking on the
same things, for he called the chiefs to a council
and said: "Who now will go and spy among the
Greeks, and see what they purpose to do on the
morrow, and whether they are keeping watch
through the night?  A goodly reward shall he
have, even a chariot and horses, the best that
there are in the camp of the Greeks."
</p>

<p>
Then stood up a certain Dolon.  Ill-favoured
was he, but a swift runner.  He said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Do'-lon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I will go, Hector; but come, lift up thy
sceptre, and swear to me that thou wilt give me
the chariot and the horses of Achilles."
</p>

<p>
So Hector sware to him.  And Dolon took his
bow, and a helmet of gray wolf-skin, and a sharp
spear, and went his way in haste.  But Ulysses
saw him, and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here cometh a man, Diomed, but whether he
be a spy or a spoiler of the dead I know not.
Let him pass by a space that we may take him.  If
he outrun us, press him with thy spear towards
the ships; only let him not turn back to the
city."
</p>

<p>
So they lay down among the dead, a little out
of the way, and Dolon passed by them unknowing;
but when he had gone a little space they
ran upon him.  For a while he stood hearkening
to their steps, for he thought that Hector had
sent comrades to call him back.  But when they
were a spear's throw from him, or less, he knew
them for foes and fled.  And as two dogs follow
a fawn or a hare, so they ran, pursuing Dolon.
And when he had well-nigh reached the trench,
for they kept him from turning back to the city,
Diomed rushed forward and cried:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stay, or I will slay thee with my spear."
</p>

<p>
And he threw the spear, but made it pass over
his shoulder, so that it stood in the ground before
him.  Then Dolon stood trembling and pale, and
with teeth chattering with fear.  And the two
heroes, breathing hard, came up and laid hands on
him.  And he said, weeping:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hold me for ransom; much gold and bronze
and iron will my father give, if he hear that I am
a prisoner at the ships."
</p>

<p>
Then said the wise Ulysses: "Tell us truly,
why wast thou coming hither through the darkness?
To spoil the dead, or, at Hector's bidding,
to spy out our affairs at the ships, or on some
errand of thine own?"
</p>

<p>
And Dolon answered, "Hector persuaded me,
promising to give me the horses and chariot of
Achilles, and he bade me go and spy out what ye
purposed to do on the morrow, and whether ye
were keeping watch in the night."
</p>

<p>
And Ulysses smiled and said: "Surely it was
a great reward that thy soul desired.  But tell
me, where is Hector, and where are the watches
of the sons of Troy?"
</p>

<p>
Then Dolon answered: "Hector holds council
with the chiefs.  As for the army, there are no
watches set, save only where be the Trojans
themselves.  As for the allies, they sleep secure, and
trust to the Trojans to watch for them, seeing that
they have not wives or children near."
</p>

<p>
Then Ulysses asked, "Do they sleep, then,
among the Trojans, or apart?"
</p>

<p>
"Next to the sea," said Dolon, "but if ye wish
to enter the camp, lo! apart from all are some
newcomers, Thracians, with Rhesus, their king.
Never have I seen horses so fair and tall as his.
Whiter are they than snow, and swifter than the
winds.  But do ye now send me to the ships, or,
if ye will, bind me and leave me here."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Thra'-ci-ans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rhe'-sus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Diomed said: "Think not to escape, Dolon,
though thy news is good; for then wouldst thou
come again to spy out our camp or to fight.  But if
I slay thee, thou wilt trouble the Greeks no more."
</p>

<p>
So he slew him, and took from him his arms,
hanging them on a tamarisk tree, and made a
mark with reeds and tamarisk boughs, that they
might know the place as they came back.  So
they went on across the plain and came to where
the men of Thrace lay sleeping, and by each man
were his arms in fair array, and his horses; but
in the midst lay King Rhesus, with his horses
tethered to the chariot-rail.  Then Diomed began
to slay.  As a lion rushes on a flock, so rushed he
on the men of Thrace.  Twelve he slew, and
as he slew them Ulysses dragged them out of
the way, that there might be a clear road for
the horses, lest they should start back, fearing the
dead bodies, for they were not used to war.  And
the thirteenth was King Rhesus himself, who panted
in his sleep, for an evil dream was on him.  And
meanwhile Ulysses drove the horses out of the
encampment, smiting them with his bow, for he had
not thought to take the whip out of the chariot.
Then he whistled, making a sign to Diomed that
he should come, for Diomed lingered, doubting
whether he might not slay yet more.  But Athene
whispered in his ear:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Think of thy return, lest some god rouse the
Trojans against thee."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Apollo was even then rousing them.
And the Trojans flocked together with tumult and
shouting.  But Diomed and Ulysses meanwhile
had mounted the horses, and were riding to the
ships.  Glad were their comrades to see them safe
returned, and praised them much for all that they
had done.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE WOUNDING OF THE CHIEFS
</h3>

<p>
When the next day dawned, King Agamemnon
called the Greeks to battle.  And on the other
side Hector set in order the men of Troy.  As a
baleful star now shineth from the clouds, and now
is hidden, so Hector now shone among the
foremost ranks, and now ordered the rearward.
</p>

<p>
Then the men of Troy and the Greeks leapt
upon each other.  As reapers reap in a rich man's
field, making the barley and the wheat fall in long
swathes, so did the Trojans and the Greeks slay
one another.  So long as the day was waxing, the
battle was equal, and the people fell alike on either
side; but at noon, the Greeks brake the Trojan
line, and Agamemnon leapt first into the breach.
As a fire falleth on a wood, and sweepeth it away,
so Agamemnon fell upon the men of Troy, and
swept them before him.  Past the Tomb of Ilus,
and past the wild fig tree in the plain, they fled,
and the King followed hard upon them, shouting
aloud.  But when they came to the Scæan gate
they turned and stood, and the battle was
renewed.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
I'-lus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then spake Zeus to Iris, saying: "Get thee
away, swift Iris, and bear this word to Hector.
So long as he shall see King Agamemnon laying
waste the ranks of men, so long let him hold back
from the battle.  But when the King shall be
wounded with spear or arrow, and shall leap from
his chariot, then let him advance, and I will give
him strength to slay till he shall come to the ships,
and the sun shall set."
</p>

<p>
So he came, and told these words to Hector.
And when Hector heard them, he leapt from his
chariot, and went up and down the ranks of Troy,
strengthening them for the fight.  And the two
hosts stood, and faced each other.
</p>

<p>
Then did King Agamemnon slay the two sons
of Antenor.  First he slew Iphidamas, smiting
him a deadly blow upon the neck.  But Coön,
Antenor's first-born son, was grieved for his
brother, and standing sideways, so that the King
saw him not, he stabbed him in the middle of the
arm, beneath the elbow, and the spear pierced it
through.  The King started, yet ceased not from
battle, and as Coön dragged his brother by the
foot out of the press, calling upon the chiefs to
help, then Agamemnon smote him with the spear,
beneath the shield, and drove him to the ground,
and then smote off his head with the sword.
Thus did Agamemnon slay the two sons of
Antenor.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
I-phid'-a-mas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Co'-on.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For a time, while the wound was warm, the
King fought as before; but when it grew cold
and stiff, great pain came upon him, and he leapt
into his chariot and bade the charioteer drive him
to the ships, for he could fight no more.
</p>

<p>
Now when Hector saw that Agamemnon, had
departed from the battle, he called aloud to the
Trojans and the allies: "Come on, and play the
man.  The leader of the Greeks is gone; and
Zeus giveth the honour unto me."
</p>

<p>
So he stirred the spirit within them.  As a
hunter setteth his dogs on a wild boar or a lion in
the field, so did Hector set the men of Troy upon
the Greeks, and he himself went among the
foremost, and plunged into the battle as a storm
cometh down upon the sea.  Many valiant men
did he slay, till Ulysses called to Diomed: "Son
of Tydeus, have we forgotten our courage?  Come
hither, and stand by me; it were shame if Hector
should take our ships."
</p>

<p>
Strong Diomed made answer, "I will, indeed,
abide with thee; but it will fare ill with us if
Zeus give the mastery to the men of Troy rather
than to us."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and slew a man, and Ulysses
another; and afterwards they slew two apiece,
making head against the men of Troy, and the
Greeks, as they fled from Hector, gladly took
breath and turned again.
</p>

<p>
Hector was quick to see what they did, and he
came upon them with a cry, and the companies of
Troy followed after him.  But when Diomed saw
him, he was afraid, and said to Ulysses, "See,
mighty Hector cometh against us; let us be firm
and stand against him."
</p>

<p>
And even as he spake he cast his spear, nor
missed his aim.  On the helmet he smote Hector;
but the spear glanced from the bronze, nor
wounded the flesh; for the helmet which Apollo
had given him saved him.  But he staggered
under the blow, falling on his knee, and darkness
came over his eyes.  And when Diomed came
after his spear, far through the foremost ranks, to
where it had lighted on the ground, then Hector,
breathing again, leapt upon his car, and drove into
the midst of the host, avoiding death.
</p>

<p>
Then Diomed, as he rushed on, with his spear in
his hand, cried aloud: "Dog, thou hast escaped
from death once more; but mischief came near
thee.  Apollo hath saved thee, to whom doubtless
thou didst pray ere thou came into the press of war.
But some time I will slay thee, if only some god
will help."
</p>

<p>
And he turned to slay the men of Troy.  But
Paris, who was in hiding behind the pillar on the
Tomb of Ilus, drew his bow, and smote him with
an arrow through the ankle of the right foot.
Loud he boasted of his aim.  "Only," he said, "I
would that I had pierced thee in the loin; then
hadst thou troubled the sons of Troy no more."
</p>

<p>
But Diomed answered: "Small good were thy
bow to thee, cowardly archer, if thou shouldst
dare to meet me face to face.  And as for this
graze on my foot, I care no more than if a woman or
child had smitten me.  Not such the wounds I deal."
</p>

<p>
Then Ulysses stood before him, while he drew
the arrow out of his foot.  Grievous was the smart
of the wound, for all his brave words.  Therefore
he leapt into his chariot, and bade drive in
haste to the ships; and Ulysses stood alone, and
none of the Greeks stood by him, for all were sore
afraid.  Then spake he to himself:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do?  It were much evil to fly
before these many foes, and yet worse were I to
be caught and slain, for truly Zeus hath sent great
fear upon the Greeks.  But why talk I thus?
'Tis only the coward that draweth back from the
war; the brave man standeth whether he smite or
be smitten."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake, the Trojans came about him
as men with dogs come about a wild boar who
stands at bay, gnashing his white teeth.  Fiercely
Ulysses stood at bay, and slew five chiefs of fame.
But one of them, before he fell, wounded him
on the side, scraping the flesh from the ribs.  High
spurted the blood from the wound, and the Trojans
shouted to see it.  Then Ulysses cried aloud
for help; three times he cried, and Menelaus
heard him, and called to Ajax, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O Ajax, I hear the voice of Ulysses; and he
shouteth as if the men of Troy had compassed him
about, and he was left alone.  Come, therefore,
let us help him, lest he come to harm, and the
Greeks have a heavy loss!"
</p>

<p>
Thus he spake, and led the way, and Ajax
followed him; and when they came to Ulysses, the
Trojans had beset him, even as the jackals beset a
long-horned hart among the hills, which a hunter
hath wounded with an arrow from the bow.  From
the hunter he flieth, while the wound is warm,
but when he groweth weak the jackals tear him.
Then cometh a lion, and the jackals flee.  So fled
the Trojans when Ajax came and stood beside
Ulysses.  Then Menelaus took Ulysses by the
hand, and led him from out the throng.
</p>

<p>
Then Ajax leapt upon the Trojans and slew
many, scouring the plain, and killing horse and
man.  But Paris, husband of Helen, stayed
Machaon from the fight, wounding him on the right
shoulder with a three-pointed arrow.  Therefore
spake Idomeneus to Nestor, "Quick, Nestor,
mount thy chariot and take Machaon with thee,
and drive quickly to the ships, for the life of a
physician is as the lives of many men!"
</p>

<p>
So Nestor mounted on his chariot, and Machaon
stood beside him.  He touched the horses, and
they flew right willingly to the ships.
</p>

<p>
Now Achilles was standing on the stern of his
ship, looking at the war, and he saw Nestor carrying
Machaon in his chariot to the ships.  Then he
called to Patroclus, and Patroclus, who was in the
tent, came forth.  Then said Achilles:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now will the Greeks soon come praying for
help, for their need is sore.  But go and see who
is this whom Nestor is taking to the ships.  His
shoulders are the shoulders of Machaon, but I saw
not his face, so swift the horses passed me by."
</p>

<p>
Then Patroclus ran to the tent of Nestor, and
stood in the door.  But when old Nestor saw him,
he went and took him by the hand, and would
have had him sit down.  But Patroclus would
not, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stay me not.  I came but to see who is this
that thou hast brought wounded from the battle.
And now I see that it is Machaon.  Therefore I
will return; for thou knowest what manner of
man is Achilles, that he is hasty and swift to
blame."
</p>

<p>
Then said Nestor: "But what careth Achilles
for the Greeks? or why doth he ask who are
wounded?  Hear what I say.  It may be that
Achilles will not go forth to the battle.  But let
him send thee forth, and the Myrmidons with
thee, and let him put his arms upon thee, so that
the sons of Troy be affrighted, thinking that he is
in the battle, and we shall have breathing space."
</p>

<p>
Then Patroclus returned to Achilles.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
THE BATTLE AT THE WALL
</h3>

<p>
Now by this time the Trojans were close upon
the trench.  But the horses stood on the brink,
fearing to leap it, for it was broad and deep, and
the Greeks had put great stakes therein.  Thus
said Polydamas.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Po-lyd'-a-mas.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Surely, Hector, this is madness that we strive
to cross the trench in our chariots, for it is broad
and deep, and there are great stakes therein.
Look, too, at this: even if we should be able to
cross it, how will the matter stand?  If, indeed,
it be the pleasure of Zeus that the Greeks should
perish utterly&mdash;it will be well.  But if they turn
upon us and pursue us, driving us back from the
ships, then shall we not be able to return.  Wherefore
let us leave our chariots here upon the brink,
and go on foot against the wall."
</p>

<p>
So they went in five companies, and Hector led
that which was bravest and largest.  And in each
company they joined shield to shield, and so went
against the Greeks.  And they all left their
chariots by the trench, save Asius only.  But
Asius drove his chariot right up to that gate which
was on the left hand in the wall.  Now the gates
chanced to be open, for the warders had opened
them, so that any of the Greeks that fled might
enter.  Now the warders were two mighty heroes;
and these, when they saw Asius and his company
coming, went without and stood in front of the
gates, just as two wild boars stand at bay against
a crowd of men and dogs.  And all the while they
that stood on the wall threw heavy stones, which
fell, thick as the snowflakes fall in the winter, on
the men of Troy, and loud rang the helmets and
the shields.  And many fell wounded to the
death, nor could Asius, for all his fury, win his
way into the walls.  But where, at another of the
gates, Hector led the way, there appeared a
strange marvel in the skies, for an eagle was
bearing in his claws a great snake, which it had taken
as a prey.  But the snake fought fiercely for its
life, and writhed itself about, even till it bit
the eagle on the breast.  Thereupon the eagle
dropped it into the midst of the host, and fled
with a loud cry.  Then Polydamas, the wise
counsellor, came near to Hector and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
A'-si-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Now it will be well that we should not follow
these Greeks to their ships.  For I take it that
this marvel that we have seen is a sign to us.
For as this eagle had caught in his claws a snake,
but held it not, dropping it before he could bear it
to his young, so shall it fare with us.  For we
shall drive the Greeks to their ships, yet shall not
subdue them, but shall return in disorder by the
way that we came, leaving full many of our
comrades behind us."
</p>

<p>
But Hector frowned, and answered: "Nay, but
this is ill counsel, Polydamas.  Dost thou bid me
forget the command of Zeus the Thunderer, and
take heed to birds, how they fly?  Little care I
whether they go to the east or to the west, to the
right or to the left.  Surely there is but one sign
for a brave man, that he be fighting for his
fatherland.  Therefore take thou heed; for if thou
holdest back from the war, or holdest back any
other, lo! I will smite thee with my spear."
</p>

<p>
Then he sprang forward, and the men of Troy
followed him with a shout.  And Zeus sent down
from Ida a great blast of wind, which bore the
dust of the plain straight to the ships, troubling
the hearts of the Greeks.  Then the Trojans
sought to drag down the battlements from the
wall, and to wrench up the posts which had been
set to strengthen it.  Nor did the Greeks give
way, but they joined shield to shield, and fought
for the wall.  And foremost among them were
Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Less.  Just as the
snow falls in mid-winter, when the winds are
hushed, and the mountain-tops are covered, and
the plains and the dwellings of men and the very
shores of the sea, up to the waves' edge, so thickly
fell the stones which the Greeks showered from
the wall against the men of Troy, and which these
again threw upon the Greeks.  And still Hector
and his men availed not to break through the
gate.  But at the last Zeus stirred up the heart of
his own son, Sarpedon.  Holding his shield before
him he went, and he shook in either hand a spear.
As goes a lion, when hunger presses him sore,
against a stall of oxen or a sheepfold, and cares
not though he find men and dogs keeping watch
against him, so Sarpedon went against the wall.
</p>

<p>
And on the other hand the Greeks strengthened
their ranks within the wall, for the matter was of
life or death.  Long time they fought with equal
might, for neither could the Lycians break through
the wall of the Greeks and make a way to the
ships, nor could the Greeks drive back the
Lycians from the wall.  Even as two neighbours,
standing with measures in their hands, contend
about some boundary, so the Lycians and the
Greeks contended for the battlements.  And many
a man was wounded with the pitiless bronze,
either smitten in the back, where he was without
defence, or smitten in front through his shield;
and all the battlements were bespattered with the
blood of men.
</p>

<p>
So it was till Zeus gave the glory to Hector.
He leapt within the wall, and cried to the men of
Troy, "Now follow me, and break down the wall,
and burn the ships."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and they heard his voice, and
rushed together on the wall.  Now in front of the
gate there lay a great stone, broad at the base and
sharp at the top.  Scarce could two men of the
strongest, such as are men in these days, move it
with levers on to a wagon; but Hector lifted it
easily, easily as a shepherd carries in one hand the
fleece of a sheep.  Two folding doors there were
in the gates, held by bolts and a key, and at these
he hurled the great stone, planting his feet apart,
that his aim might be the surer and stronger.
With a mighty crash it came against the gates.
and the bolts held not against it, and the hinges
were broken, so that the folding doors flew back.
Then Hector leapt into the space, holding a spear
in either hand, and his eyes flashed as fire.  And
the men of Troy came after him, some mounting
the wall, and some pouring through the gates.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE BATTLE AT THE SHIPS
</h3>

<p>
And when Zeus had brought the Trojans near
to the ships, he turned away his eyes, and looked
upon them no more, for he deemed that none of the
immortal gods would come to help either Trojan
or Greek.  But Poseidon was watching the battle
from the wooded height of Samothrace, whence he
could see Ida and Troy and the ships.  And he
pitied the Greeks, when he saw how they fled
before Hector, and purposed in his heart to help
them.  So he left the height of Samothrace, and
came with four strides to his palace in the depths
of the sea.  There he harnessed the horses to his
chariot, and rode, passing over the waves, and the
great beasts of the sea gambolled about him as he
went, knowing their king.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Po-sei'-don.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sa-mo-thrace'.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
His horses he stabled in a cavern of the sea, and
loosed them from the car, and gave them immortal
food to eat, and put shackles of gold about their
feet.
</p>

<p>
And all the while the men of Troy came on,
following Hector, like a storm or a great flame,
for they thought to take the ships and to slay the
Greeks beside them.
</p>

<p>
But Poseidon came to the camp of the Greeks,
taking upon him the shape of Calchas the herald.
First he spake to either Ajax, saying: "Hold
fast, ye men of might, so that ye save the people.
For the rest of the wall I fear not, but only for
the place where Hector rages."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Cal'-chas.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And as he spake, he smote each with his staff,
and filled them with courage, and gave strength
to hands and feet.  Then he passed from them
even as a hawk that riseth from a cliff, chasing a
bird.
</p>

<p>
And the Lesser Ajax knew him, and spake to
his comrade, saying: "This is some god that bids
us fight for the ships; he was not Calchas, for I
marked the goings of his legs and his feet as he
went.  The gods are easily discerned.  And
verily my heart within me is eager for the fight."
</p>

<p>
The Greater Ajax answered him, "Even so do
my own hands yearn about the spear, and my
heart is on fire, and my feet carry me away, and I
am eager to fight with Hector, even I alone, for
all his fury."
</p>

<p>
Then Poseidon went to the other chiefs, going
up and down the ranks, and urged them to stand
fast against their enemies.  But not the less did
the men of Troy press on, Hector leading the way.
</p>

<p>
And so loud was the cry of battle that it roused
old Nestor where he sat in his tent, tending the
wounded Machaon.  So he went forth from the
tent, seeking King Agamemnon.  And as he went,
the King met him, and with him were Diomed and
Ulysses, who also had been wounded that day.
So they held counsel together.  And Agamemnon&mdash;for
it troubled him sore that the people were
slain&mdash;would that they should draw down
the ships into the sea, and should flee homewards,
as soon as the darkness should cover them and the
Trojans should cease from the battle.
</p>

<p>
But Ulysses would have none of such counsel,
saying: "Now surely, son of Atreus, thou art not
worthy to rule over us, who have been men of war
from our youth.  Wilt thou leave this city, for
the taking of which we have suffered so much?
That may not be; let not any one of the Greeks
hear thee say such words.  And what is this, that
thou wouldst have us launch our ships now, whilst
the hosts are fighting?  Surely, so doing, we
should perish together, for the Greeks would not
fight any more, seeing that the ships were being
launched, and the men of Troy would slay us
altogether."
</p>

<p>
Then King Agamemnon said, "Thou speakest
well."  And he went through the host, bidding
the men bear themselves bravely; and all the
while Poseidon put courage and strength into
their hearts; and, on the other hand, Hera lulled
Zeus to sleep on the heights of Olympus, so that
now the battle went against the men of Troy.
</p>

<p>
And Ajax took a great stone&mdash;now were there
many such which they had as props for the ships&mdash;and
smote Hector above the rim of his shield,
on the neck.  As an oak falls, stricken by the
thunder of Zeus, so he fell, and the Greeks rushed
with a great cry to drag him to them, but could
not, for all the bravest of the sons of Troy held
their shields before him.  Then they carried him
to the river, and poured water upon him.  And
after a while he sat up, and then again his spirit
left him, for the blow had been very grievous.
But when the Greeks saw that Hector had been
carried out of the battle, they pressed on the more,
slaying the men of Troy, and driving them back
even out of the camp and across the trench.  But
when they came to their chariots, where they had
left them on the other side of the trench, there
they stood trembling and pale with fear, as men
that flee in the day of battle.
</p>

<p>
And now Zeus woke from his sleep, and he
looked upon the earth; and he saw how the
Greeks were driving the men of Troy before them,
and Hector lay upon the plain, and vomited blood,
and his friends knelt about him.  Senseless he
lay, for it was no puny hand that had dealt the
blow.  Very wroth was Zeus to see such a sight,
and he said to Hera: "What is this that thou hast
done, sending Hector from the battle?  Rememberest
thou not how I hung thee amid the clouds
with a band of gold about thy hands and an anvil
of gold on either foot?  Make an end of thy
deceits, or verily nothing shall protect thee from
my wrath."  to
</p>

<p>
Then Hera answered: "It is Poseidon that
afflicts the Trojans, and bears up the Greeks."
</p>

<p>
Then said Zeus: "Call hither Iris and Apollo
the Archer; let Iris go to Poseidon, and bid him
cease from the battle, and let Apollo strengthen
Hector, that he may go back to the battle; so
shall my will be accomplished, fulfilling the oath
that I sware to Thetis of the sea that I would do
honour to her son."
</p>

<p>
Then Iris went to Poseidon, and gave him the
message of Zeus.  Very wroth was the god, and
said: "Thinketh he then to control me by force
who am his equal in honour?  Three brethren are
we, and the Fates gave the sea to me for my
dominion, and to Hades the realm of darkness, and
to Zeus the heaven; but the earth is for all.  I
walk not by the will of Zeus; let him remain in
his own possessions, and meddle not."
</p>

<p>
But Iris answered: "Shaker of the earth, shall
I bear back so rough an answer to Zeus?  Surely
thou knowest the might of the elder born?"
</p>

<p>
Then Poseidon said, "Iris, thou speakest well;
this time will I yield, but know that if he shall
scorn me and the other gods and let Troy stand
untaken, and give not victory to the Greeks,
there shall be endless feud between him and me."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Apollo went, at the bidding of Zeus,
to Hector.  He found him sitting up, for the will
of Zeus had revived him.  Then spake Apollo:
"Hector, why sittest thou apart from thy fellows?
Hath trouble come upon thee?"
</p>

<p>
Hector made reply in a feeble voice: "Who
art thou among the gods that speakest to me?
Knowest thou not that Ajax smote me with a
mighty stone and stayed me from the battle?
Verily I thought that I had gone down this day
to the dwellings of the dead."
</p>

<p>
But Apollo said: "Be of good cheer, for Zeus
hath sent me, who am Apollo of the Golden Sword,
to stand by thee and to succour thee.  Come now,
and bid thy people advance toward the ships, and
I will go before thee, and make the way easy for
thy horses."
</p>

<p>
So Hector rose up in his might, and entered
into the battle.  And as men that chase a stag or a
wild goat, and lo! a lion crosseth their path, so
were the Greeks afraid when they saw Hector, the
son of Priam.  And one spake, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Surely this is a great marvel that I see with
mine eyes.  For we thought that Hector had been
slain by the hand of Ajax, son of Telamon, and
now, behold! he is come back to the battle.  Many
Greeks have fallen before him, and many, methinks,
will fall, for of a truth some god has raised
him up and helps him.  But come, let all the
bravest stand together.  So, mighty though he be,
he shall fear to enter our array."
</p>

<p>
And all the bravest gathered together and stood
in the front, but the multitude made for the ships.
But Hector came on, and Apollo before him, and
many of the Greeks fell slain before the sons of
Troy.  Thus the battle turned again, and came
near to the trench; and now Apollo made it easy
for the men of Troy to pass, so that they left not
their chariots, as before, upon the brink, but drave
them across.
</p>

<p>
And still the men of Troy came on, and still
the Greeks gave way.  So they came again, these
pushing forward and these yielding ground, to the
ships.  And Hector caught hold of one of them,
and the battle raged about it; for the men of
Troy and the Greeks were gathered round, and
none fought with arrows or javelins from afar, but
man to man, with battle-axe and sword and great
spears pointed at either end.  And many a fair
weapon lay shattered on the ground, and the
earth flowed with blood as with a river.  But still
Hector held the stem of the ship with his hand,
and called to the men of Troy that they should
bring fire, for Zeus had given them the
victory that day.  Then even Ajax himself gave
way, so did the spears of the Trojans press him;
for now he stood no longer upon the stern deck,
but on the rowers' bench, thrusting thence with
his spear at any one who sought to set fire to the
ship.  And ever he cried to the Greeks with a
terrible voice:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O ye Greeks! now must ye bear yourselves
like men.  For have ye any helpers behind? or
have ye any walls to shelter you?  We are here
in the plain of Troy, and the sea is close behind
us, and we are far from our country.  Wherefore
all our hope is in valour, and not in shrinking
back from the battle."
</p>

<p>
And still he thrust with his spear, if any of the
men of Troy, at Hector's bidding, sought to bring
fire against the ships.  Full twelve he wounded
where he stood.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE DEEDS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS
</h3>

<p>
Now Patroclus stood by Achilles, weeping
bitterly.  Then said Achilles: "What ails thee,
Patroclus, that thou weepest like a girl-child that
runs along by her mother's side, and would be
taken up, holding her gown, and looking at her
with tearful eyes till she lift her in her arms?
Hast thou heard evil news from home?  Or art
thou weeping for the Greeks, because they perish
for their folly?"
</p>

<p>
Then said Patroclus: "Be not wroth with me,
great Achilles, for indeed the Greeks are in grievous
straits, and all their bravest are wounded, and
still thou cherishest thy wrath.  If thou goest not
to the battle, fearing some warning from the gods,
let me go, and thy Myrmidons with me.  And let
me put thy armour on me; so shall the Greeks
have breathing-space from the war."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, entreating, nor knew that for his
own doom he entreated.  And Achilles made
reply:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is no warning that I heed, that I keep back
from the war.  These men took from me my prize,
which I won with my own hands.  But let the
past be past.  I said that I would not rise up till
the battle should come nigh to my own ships.
But thou mayest put my armour upon thee, and
lead my Myrmidons to the fight.  For in truth
the men of Troy are gathered as a dark cloud
about the ships, and the Greeks have scarce
standing-ground between them and the sea.  For they
see not the gleam of my helmet, and Diomed is
not there with his spear; nor do I hear the voice
of Agamemnon, but only the voice of Hector, as
he calls the men of Troy to the battle.  Go,
therefore, Patroclus, and drive the fire from the ships.
And then come thou back, nor fight any more
with the Trojans, lest thou take my glory from
me.  And go not near, in the delight of battle, to
the walls of Troy, lest one of the gods meet thee
to thy hurt: for the keen-archer Apollo loves the
Trojans well."
</p>

<p>
But as they talked the one to the other, Ajax
could hold out no longer.  For swords and
javelins came thick upon him, and clattered on his
helmet, and his shoulder was weary with the great
shield which he held; and he breathed heavily
and hard, and the great drops of sweat fell upon
the ground.  Then at the last Hector came near
and smote his spear with a great sword, so that the
head fell off.  Then was Ajax sore afraid, and gave
way, and the men of Troy set torches to the ship's
stem, and a great flame shot up to the sky.  And
Achilles saw it, and smote his thigh and spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Haste thee, Patroclus, for I see the fire rising
up from the ships.  Put thou on the armour, and
I will call my people to the war."
</p>

<p>
So Patroclus put on the armour,&mdash;corselet, and
shield, and helmet,&mdash;and bound upon his shoulder
the silver-studded sword, and took a mighty spear
in his hand.  But the great spear of Achilles he
took not, for that no man but Achilles might
wield.  Then Automedon yoked the horses to the
chariot, Bayard and Piebald, and with them in the
side harness, Pedasus; and the two first were
deathless steeds, but the third was mortal.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Au-tom'-e-don.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ped'-a-sus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Meanwhile Achilles had called the Myrmidons
to battle.  Fifty ships had he brought to Troy,
and in each there were fifty men.
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles said: "Forget not, ye Myrmidons,
the bold words that ye spake against the
men of Troy during the days of my wrath, making
complaint that I kept you from the battle against
your will.  Now, therefore, ye have that which
ye desired."
</p>

<p>
So the Myrmidons went to the battle in close
array, helmet to helmet and shield to shield, close
as the stones with which a builder builds a wall
And in front went Patroclus, and Automedon in
the chariot beside him.  Then Achilles went to
his tent and took from the chest a great cup,
which Thetis his mother had given him.  Now no
man drank of that cup but he only, nor did he
pour out of it offerings to any of the gods except
to Zeus.  This first he cleansed with sulphur, and
then with water from the spring.  And after this
he washed his hands, and stood in the midst of the
space before his tent, and poured out of it to Zeus,
saying, "O Zeus, I send my comrade to this
battle; make him strong and bold, and give him
glory, and bring him home safe to the ships, and
my people with him."
</p>

<p>
So he prayed, and Father Zeus heard him, and
part he granted and part denied.
</p>

<p>
But now Patroclus with the Myrmidons had
come to where the battle was raging about the
ships, and when the men of Troy beheld him, they
thought that Achilles had forgotten his wrath and
was come forth to the war.  Then the men of
Troy turned to flee, and many chiefs of fame fell
by the spears of the Greeks.  So the battle rolled
back to the trench, and in the trench many chariots
of the Trojans were broken, but the horses of
Achilles went across it at a stride, so nimble were
they and strong.  And the heart of Patroclus was
set to slay Hector; but he could not overtake him,
so swift were his horses.  Then did Patroclus turn
his chariot, and keep back those that fled, and
rushed hither and thither, still slaying as he went.
</p>

<p>
But Sarpedon, when he saw the Lycians dismayed
and scattered, called to them that they
should be of good courage, saying that he would
himself make trial of this great warrior.  So he
leapt down from his chariot, and Patroclus also
leapt down, and they rushed at each other as two
eagles rush together.  And Sarpedon, who had a
spear in either hand, with the one struck the
horse Pedasus, which was of mortal breed, on the
right shoulder, and with the other missed his aim,
sending it over the left shoulder of Patroclus.
But Patroclus missed not his aim, driving his
spear into Sarpedon's heart.  Then fell the great
Lycian chief, as an oak, or a poplar, or a pine falls
upon the hills before the axe.  But he called to
Glaucus, his companion, saying: "Now must thou
show thyself a good warrior, Glaucus.  First call
the men of Lycia to fight for me, and do thou fight
thyself, for it would be foul shame to thee, all
thy days, if the Greeks should spoil me of my
arms."
</p>

<p>
Then with a great shout the Lycians and the
Trojans charged, and drove the Greeks back a
space from the body; and then again the Greeks
did the like.  And so the battle raged, till no one
would have known the great Sarpedon, so covered
was he with spears and blood and dust.  But at
the last the Greeks drave back the men of Troy
from the body, and stripped the arms, but the
body itself they harmed not.  For Apollo came
down at the bidding of Zeus and carried it out of
the midst of the battle, and washed it with water,
and anointed it with ambrosia, and wrapped it in
garments of the gods.  And then he gave it to
Sleep and Death, and these two carried it to
Lycia, his fatherland.
</p>

<p>
Then did Patroclus forget the word which
Achilles had spoken to him, that he should not
go near to Troy, for he pursued the men to the
city, even to the wall.  Thrice he mounted on the
angle of the wall, and thrice Apollo himself drove
him back, pushing his shining shield.  But the
fourth time the god said: "Go thou back,
Patroclus.  It is not for thee to take the city of
Troy; no, nor for Achilles, who is far better than
thou art."
</p>

<p>
So Patroclus went back, fearing the wrath of
the archer god.  Then Apollo stirred up the spirit
of Hector, that he should go against Patroclus.
Therefore he went, with his brother Cebriones for
driver of his chariot.  But when they came near,
Patroclus cast a great stone which he had in his
hand, and smote Cebriones on the forehead, crushing
it in, so that he fell headlong from the chariot.
And Patroclus mocked him, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Ceb-ri'-o-nes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"How nimble is this man! how lightly he
dives!  What spoil he would take of oysters,
diving from a ship, even in a stormy sea!  Who
would have thought that there were such skilful
divers in Troy!"
</p>

<p>
Then again the battle waxed hot about the body
of Cebriones, and this too, at the last, the Greeks
drew unto themselves, and spoiled it of the arms.
And this being accomplished, Patroclus rushed
against the men of Troy.  Thrice he rushed, and
each time he slew nine chiefs of fame.  But the
fourth time Apollo stood behind him and struck
him on the head and shoulders, so that his eyes
were darkened.  And the helmet fell from off his
head, so that the horse-hair plumes were soiled
with dust.  Never before had it touched the
ground, for it was the helmet of Achilles.  And
also the god brake the spear in his hand, and
struck the shield from his arms, and loosed his
corselet.  All amazed he stood, and then Euphorbus
smote him on the back with his spear, but
slew him not.  Then Patroclus sought to flee to
the ranks of his comrades.  But Hector saw him,
and thrust at him with his spear, smiting him in
the groin, so that he fell.  And when the Greeks
saw him fail, they sent up a terrible cry.  Then
Hector stood over him and cried:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Didst thou think to spoil our city, Patroclus,
and to carry away our wives and daughters in the
ships?  But lo! I have slain thee, and the fowls
of the air shall eat thy flesh; nor shall the great
Achilles help thee at all&mdash;  Achilles, who bade
thee strip the tunic from my breast, and thou
thoughtest in thy folly to do it."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Eu-phor'-bus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Patroclus answered: "Thou boasteth much,
Hector.  Yet thou didst not slay me, but Apollo,
who took from me my arms, for had twenty such
as thou met me, I had slain them all.  And mark
thou this: death and fate are close to thee by the
hand of the great Achilles."
</p>

<p>
And Hector answered, but Patroclus was dead
already: "Why dost thou prophesy death to me?
May be the great Achilles himself shall fall by my
hand.
</p>

<p>
Then he drew his spear from the wound, and
went after Automedon, to slay him, but the swift
horses of Achilles carried him away.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
<br><br>
THE ROUSING OF ACHILLES
</h3>

<p>
Fierce was the fight about the body of Patroclus,
and many heroes fell, both on this side and
on that, and first of them all Euphorbus, who first
had wounded him.  For as he came near to strip
the dead man of his arms, Menelaus slew him with
his spear.  He slew him, but took not his arms,
for Hector came through the battle; nor did
Menelaus dare to abide his coming, but went back
into the ranks of his own people.  Then did Hector
strip off the arms of Patroclus, the arms which
the great Achilles had given him to wear.  Then
he laid hold of the body, and would have dragged
it into the host of the Trojans, but Ajax Telamon
came forth, and put his broad shield before it, as
a lion stands before its cubs when the hunters
meet it in the woods, drawing down over its eyes
its shaggy brows.  Then Hector gave place, but
Glaucus saw him, and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now is this a shame to thee, that thou darest
not to stand against Ajax.  How wilt thou and
thy countrymen save the city of Troy?  For
surely no more will thy allies fight for it.  Small
profit have they of thee.  Did not Sarpedon fall,
and didst thou not leave him to be a prey to the
dogs?  And now, if thou hadst stood firm and
carried off Patroclus, we might have made
exchange, and gained from the Greeks Sarpedon and
his arms.  But it may not be, for thou fearest
Ajax, and fleest before him."
</p>

<p>
But Hector said: "I fear him not, nor any
man.  Only Zeus giveth victory now to one man
and now to another.  But wait thou here, and see
whether I be a coward, as thou sayest."
</p>

<p>
Now he had sent the armour of Patroclus to the
city.  But now he ran after those that were carrying
it, and overtook them, and put on the armour
himself (but Zeus saw him doing it, and liked it
not), and came back to the battle; and all who
saw him thought that it had been the great Achilles
himself.  Then they all charged together, and
fiercer grew the battle and fiercer as the day went
on.  For the Greeks said one to another: "Now
had the earth better yawn and swallow us up alive,
than we should let the men of Troy carry off
Patroclus to their city;" and the Trojans said:
"Now if we must all fall by the body of this man,
be it so, but we will not yield."  But the horses
of Achilles stood apart from the battle, when they
knew that Patroclus was dead, and wept.  Nor
could Automedon move them with the lash, nor
with gentle words, nor with threats.  They would
not return to the ships, nor would they go into the
battle; but as a pillar stands on the tomb of some
dead man, so they stood, with their heads drooped
to the ground, and with big tears dropping to the
earth, and their long manes trailing in the dust.
</p>

<p>
But Father Zeus beheld them, and pitied them,
and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It was not well that we gave you, immortal as
ye are, to a mortal man; for of all things that,
move on earth, mortal man is the fullest of
sorrow.  But Hector shall not possess you.  It is
enough for him, yea, and too much, that he hath
the arms of Achilles."
</p>

<p>
Then did the horses move from their place, and
obey their charioteers as before.  Nor could
Hector take them, though he desired them very much.
And all the while the battle raged about the dead
Patroclus.  And at last Ajax said to Menelaus
(now these two had borne themselves more
bravely in the fight than all others):&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"See if thou canst find Antilochus, Nestor's
son, that he may carry the tidings to Achilles,
how that Patroclus is dead."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
An-til'-o-chus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So Menelaus went and found Antilochus on the
left of the battle, and said to him: "I have ill
news for thee.  Thou seest that the men of Troy
have the victory to-day.  And also Patroclus lies
dead.  Run, therefore, to Achilles, and tell him,
if haply he may save the body; but as for the
arms, Hector has them already."
</p>

<p>
Sore dismayed was Antilochus to hear such tidings,
and his eyes were filled with tears, and his
voice was choked.  Yet did he give heed to the
words of Menelaus, and ran to tell Achilles of
what had chanced.  But Menelaus went back to
Ajax, where he had left him by Patroclus, and
said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Antilochus, indeed, bears the tidings to Achilles.
Yet I doubt whether he will come, for all his
wrath against Hector, seeing that he has no
armour to cover him.  Let us think, then, how
we may best carry Patroclus away from the men
of Troy."
</p>

<p>
Then said Ajax, "Do thou and Meriones run
forward and raise the body in your arms, and I
and Ajax the Less will keep off, meanwhile, the
men of Troy."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Me-ri'-o-nes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So Menelaus and Meriones ran forward and
lifted up the body, And the Trojans ran forward
with a great shout when they saw them, as dogs
run barking before the hunters when they chase a
wild boar; but when the beast turns to bay, then
they flee this way and that.  So did the men of
Troy flee when Ajax the Greater and Ajax the
Less turned to give battle.  But still the Greeks
gave way, and still the Trojans came on, and ever
in the front were Hector, the son of Priam, and
Æneas, the son of Anchises.  But in the
meantime Antilochus came near to Achilles, who,
indeed, seeing that the Greeks fled and the men of
Troy pursued, was already sore afraid.  And he
said, weeping as he spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
An-chi'-ses.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I bring ill news,&mdash;Patroclus lies low.  The
Greeks fight for his body, but Hector has his
arms."
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles took of the dust of the plain in
his hand, and poured it on his head, and lay at his
length upon the ground, and tare his hair.  And
all the women wailed.  And Antilochus sat weeping;
but ever he held the hands of Achilles, lest
he should slay himself in his great grief.
</p>

<p>
Then came his mother, hearing his cry, from
where she sat in the depths of the sea, and laid
her hand on him and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why weepest thou, my son?  Hide not the
matter from me, but tell me."
</p>

<p>
And Achilles answered: "All that Zeus promised
thee for me he hath fulfilled.  But what
profit have I, for my friend Patroclus is dead,
and Hector has the arms which I gave him to
wear.  And as for me, I care not to live, except I
can avenge me upon him."
</p>

<p>
Then said Thetis: "Nay, my son, speak not
thus.  For when Hector dieth, thy doom also is
near."
</p>

<p>
And Achilles spake in great wrath: "Would
that I might die this hour, seeing that I could not
help my friend, but am a burden on the earth&mdash;I,
who am better in battle than all the Greeks
besides.  Cursed be the wrath that sets men to
strive the one with the other, even as it set me to
strive with King Agamemnon!  But let the past
be past.  And as for my fate&mdash;let it come when
it may, so that I first avenge myself on Hector.
Therefore, seek not to keep me back from the
battle."
</p>

<p>
Then Thetis said: "Be it so; only thou canst
not go without thy arms, which Hector hath.
But to-morrow will I go to Hephæstus, that he
may furnish thee anew."
</p>

<p>
But while they talked the men of Troy pressed
the Greeks more and more, and the two heroes,
Ajax the Greater and Ajax the Less, could no
longer keep Hector back, but that he should lay
hold of the body of Patroclus.  And indeed he
would have taken it, but that Zeus sent Iris to
Achilles, who said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Rouse thee, son of Peleus, or Patroclus will
be a prey for the dogs of Troy!"
</p>

<p>
But Achilles said: "How shall I go?&mdash;for
arms have I none, nor know I whose I might
wear."
</p>

<p>
Then answered Iris, "Go only to the trench and
show thyself; so shall the men of Troy tremble
and cease from the battle, and the Greeks shall
have breathing-space."
</p>

<p>
Then went he to the trench; with the battle he
mingled not, heeding his mother's commands, but
he shouted aloud, and his voice was as the sound
of a trumpet.  And when the men of Troy heard,
they were stricken with fear, and the horses backed
with the chariots, and the drivers were astonished
when they saw the flaming fire above his head
which Athene had kindled.  Thrice across the
trench the great Achilles shouted, and thrice the
men of Troy fell back.  And that hour there
perished twelve chiefs of fame, wounded by their
own spears or trampled by their own steeds, so
great was the terror among the men of Troy.
</p>

<p>
Right gladly did the Greeks take Patroclus out
of the press.  Then they laid him on a bier, and
carried him to the tent, Achilles walking with
many tears by his side.
</p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE MAKING OF THE ARMS
</h3>

<p>
And Achilles stood among his Myrmidons and
said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Vain was the promise that I made to Menœtius
that I would bring back his son with his portion
of the spoils of Troy.  For he lies dead, nor
shall I return to the house of Peleus, my father,
for I, too, must die in this land.  But thee, O
Patroclus, I will not bury till I bring hither the
head and the arms of Hector, and twelve men of
Troy to slay at thy funeral pile."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Men-œ'-ti-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So they washed the body of Patroclus and
anointed it, putting ointment nine years old into
the wounds, and laid it on a bed, and covered it
with a linen cloth from the head to the feet, and
laid a white robe over it.  All night the Myrmidons
mourned for Patroclus dead.
</p>

<p>
But Thetis went to the house of Hephæstus.
She found him busy at his work, making twenty
cauldrons with three feet, that were to stand about
the house of the gods.  Golden wheels had they
beneath, that they might go of their own motion
into the chambers of the gods, and of their own
motion return.  But Grace, the wife of Hephæstus,
espied Thetis, and caught her by the hands,
and led her in, and set her on a silver-studded
chair, and put a chair beneath her feet.  Then she
called to her husband, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come quick.  Thetis would have somewhat of
thee."
</p>

<p>
And he said: "Verily, she was my saviour in
the day of trouble; for my mother cast me out
because I was lame, but Thetis and her sister
received me in the sea.  Nine years I dwelt with
them, and hammered many a trinket in a hollow
cave.  Verily, I would pay the price of my life
for Thetis."
</p>

<p>
Then he put away his tools, and washed himself,
and took a staff in his hand, and came into the
house, and sat upon a chair, and said: "Speak all
thy mind.  I will do thy pleasure, if it can be
done."
</p>

<p>
Then did Thetis tell him of her son Achilles,
and of the wrong that had been done to him, and
of his wrath, and of how Patroclus was dead, and
that the arms that he had had were lost.
</p>

<p>
"Make me now," she said, "for him a shield
and a helmet, and greaves, and a corselet."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
greaves, armour for the legs.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And Hephæstus answered: "Be of good cheer.
Would that I could keep from him the doom of
death as easily as I can make him such arms that
a man will wonder when he looks upon them."
</p>

<p>
Then he went to his smithy, and turned the
bellows to the fire, and bade them work.  Also he
put bronze and tin and gold and silver into the
fire, to melt them, and set the anvil, and took the
hammer in one hand, and the tongs in the other.
</p>

<p>
First he made a shield, great and strong, and
fastened thereto a belt of silver.  On it he
wrought the earth, and the sky, and the sea, and
the sun, and the moon, and all the stars.  He
wrought also two cities.  In the one there was
peace, and about the other there was war.  For in
the first they led a bride to her home with music
and dancing, and the women stood in the doors to
see the show, but about the other city there sat an
army besieging it, and the men of the city stood
upon the wall defending it.  These had also set an
ambush by a river where the herds were wont to
drink.  And when the herds came down, they
rose up and took them and slew the herdsmen.
But the army of the besiegers heard the cry, and
came swiftly on horses, and fought by the bank of
the river.  Also he wrought one field where many
men drove the plough, and another where reapers
reaped the corn, and boys gathered it in their
arms to bind into sheaves, while the lord stood
glad at heart, beholding them.  Also he wrought
a vineyard, wherein was a path, and youths and
maidens bearing baskets of grapes, and in the
midst a boy played on a harp of gold and sang a
pleasant song.  Also he made a herd of oxen
going from the stables to the pastures, and
herdsmen and dogs, and in the front two lions had
caught a mighty bull and were devouring it, while
the dogs stood far off and barked.  Also he made
a sheepfold; also a marvellous dance of men and
maidens, and these had coronets of gold, and those
daggers of gold hanging from belts of silver.
And round about the shield he wrought the great
river of ocean.
</p>

<p>
Besides the shield, he also made corselet
brighter than fire, and a great helmet with a ridge
of gold for the crest, and greaves of tin.  And
when he had finished all the armour, he set them
before the mother of Achilles.  Like to a hawk
did she leap from Olympus, carrying them to her
son.  And when she came to the ships, she found
him lying on the earth with his arms about the
body of Patroclus, weeping aloud, and his men
stood about lamenting.
</p>

<p>
The goddess stood in the midst, and clasped her
son by the hand, and spake: "Come, now, let us
leave the dead man; for he hath been slain
according to the ordering of the gods.  And do thou
receive from Hephæstus this armour, exceeding
beautiful, such as man never yet wore upon his
shoulders."
</p>

<p>
So she spake, and cast the armour before
Achilles.  Loud did it rattle as it fell, and the
Myrmidons feared to look upon the sight.  But
Achilles took the splendid armour into his hand,
and was glad, and spake, saying: "Mother, the
gods have given me arms, such as it is fitting
should be made in heaven, and I vow I will arm
me for the fight.  Yet much I fear that decay will
mar the body of Patroclus, now that the life hath
gone from out of it."
</p>

<p>
But Thetis made answer: "Let not this trouble
thee; I will keep decay from his flesh, yea, though
he should lie here till the year come round again.
Go, then, and call the people to the assembly, and
put away thy wrath against King Agamemnon,
and arm thyself for the battle."
</p>

<p>
So she spake, putting trust and valour into his
soul; and into the nostrils of the dead man she
poured ambrosia and ruddy nectar, that his flesh
might be sweet.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
THE ENDING OF THE STRIFE
</h3>

<p>
Achilles went along the shore of the sea,
shouting aloud to the warriors.  And at his call
they came; and also Diomed and Ulysses came to
the assembly, leaning on spears, for their wounds
were fresh, and King Agamemnon.
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles stood up, and spake: "It was ill
done, son of Atreus, that we strove for a woman!
Would that Artemis had slain her with an arrow
on the day when I took her captive!  Many a
Greek who hath now bitten the ground had then
lived, and the Trojans had not reaped such profit
from our wrath.  But come, let the past be past.
Here I make an end of my anger.  And now make
haste, and send the Greeks to battle.  Let us see
whether the men of Troy will camp beside the
ships."
</p>

<p>
Then said Agamemnon, speaking from his
place: "Listen, ye Greeks.  Oft have ye blamed
me for this quarrel.  Yet it was not I that was in
fault; rather it was Zeus and Fate, and the Fury
that walketh in darkness.  But to thee, Achilles,
I make full amends, for here I offer thee the gifts
which Ulysses promised thee yesterday.  Stay
for a time, while my people bring them from
my ships."
</p>

<p>
To him Achilles made answer: "Give thy gifts,
O King, if it be thy will, or keep them to thyself.
But let us turn without delay to the battle."
</p>

<p>
Then spake the wise Ulysses: "Achilles, urge
not the Greeks to enter fasting into the battle:
for verily the strife will not be short.  A man
that hath not eaten cannot fight till set of sun, for
his limbs grow heavy unawares, and he is hindered
by hunger and thirst.  Bid, therefore, the people
disperse, and make ready their food.  Meanwhile,
let King Agamemnon send for the gifts and
deliver them to thee in full assembly.  And
afterwards let him furnish a feast."
</p>

<p>
Then said the King: "Thou speakest well,
Ulysses.  Do them thyself fetch the gifts, and let
the herald fetch us a boar, that we may do sacrifice
to Zeus and to the Sun."
</p>

<p>
But Achilles said: "Now the dead whom Hector
slew lieth low, and ye bid me think of food.
Let the Greeks enter fasting into battle, and make
them a great supper when the sun goes down.  As
for me, neither food nor drink shall pass my
lips."
</p>

<p>
To him Ulysses made reply: "Thou art the
stronger, son of Peleus, yet I may be the wiser,
for I am older than thou, and of more experience.
Ask not the Greeks to fast because of the dead.
Verily they fall every day.  Rather let us bury
him that dieth, and bewail him for a day, and
harden our hearts to forget: and then let us who
are left eat and drink, that we may fight with
better heart."
</p>

<p>
Then did Ulysses go to the tent of the King;
and they brought thence the gifts, the treasure,
and twelve horses, and seven women, skilled
workers with the needle, and the fair Briseis the
eighth.
</p>

<p>
These the Myrmidons took to the tent of Achilles.
But when Briseis saw Patroclus, she beat
her breast and her fair face and neck, and wailed
aloud, for he had been gentle and good, she said.
And all the women wailed with her, thinking
each of her own sorrows.
</p>

<p>
Then the chiefs would have Achilles feast with
them; but he hearkened not, for he would neither
eat nor drink till he had had vengeance for the
dead.  And he spake, saying: "Often, Patroclus,
hast thou ordered the feast when we were hastening
to the war.  And now thou liest slain, and
for grief for thee I cannot eat nor drink.  For
greater sorrow could not have come to me.
Often did I think that I only should perish here,
but that thou shouldst return and show my son
all that was mine, goods and servants and palace."
</p>

<p>
And as he wept, the old men wept with him,
thinking each of what he had left at home.
</p>

<p>
But Zeus said to Athene: "Carest thou not for
Achilles that is so dear to thee?  See, the other
Greeks are gone to their meal, but he sits fasting."
</p>

<p>
Then Athene leapt down from heaven, and shed
into the breast of Achilles nectar and ambrosia,
that his knees should not fail from hunger.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Greeks poured out to battle, and
in the midst Achilles armed himself.  He put the
lordly greaves about his legs, and fitted the corselet
on his breast.  From his shoulders he hung the
sword, and he took the great shield that Hephæstus
had made, and it blazed as it were the heaven.
Also he put the helmet on his head, and the plumes
waved all around.  Then he made trial of the
arms, and they fitted him well, and bare him up
like wings.  Last he drew from its case his father's
spear, which none might wield but Achilles' self.
Then he spake to his horses: "Take heed, Bayard
and Piebald, that ye save your driver to-day, nor
leave him dead on the field, as ye left Patroclus."
</p>

<p>
Then Hera gave to the horse Bayard a voice,
so that he spake: "Surely we will save thee,
great Achilles; yet for all that, doom is near to
thee, nor are we the cause, but the gods and
mastering Fate.  Nor was it of us that Patroclus
died, but Apollo slew him and gave the glory to
Hector.  So shalt thou, too, die by the hands of a
god and of a mortal man."
</p>

<p>
And Achilles said: "What need to tell me of
my doom?  Right well I know it.  Yet will I not
cease till I have made the Trojans weary of
battle."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
THE BATTLE AT THE RIVER
</h3>

<p>
Thus did Achilles go again into the battle,
eager above all things to meet with Hector and to
slay him.
</p>

<p>
But Apollo stood by Æneas, and spake to him,
"Æneas, where are now thy boastings that thou
wouldst meet Achilles face to face?"
</p>

<p>
Then Æneas answered: "Nay, I have stood up
against him in the day when he took the town of
Lyrnessus.  But I fled before him, and only my
nimble feet saved me from falling by his spear.
Surely a god is ever with him, making his spear
to fly aright."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Lyr-nes'-sus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Him Apollo answered again: "Thou, too, art
the son of a goddess, and thy mother is greater
than his, for she is but a daughter of the Sea.
Drive straight at him with thy spear, and let not
his threats dismay thee."
</p>

<p>
Then Æneas cast his spear, and it struck the
shield of Achilles with so dreadful a sound that
the hero feared lest it should pierce it through,
knowing not that the gifts of the gods are not
easy for mortal man to vanquish.  Two folds,
indeed, it pierced, that were of bronze, but in the
gold it was stayed, and there were yet two of tin
within.  Then Achilles cast his spear.  Through
the shield of Æneas it passed, and though it
wounded him not, yet was he sore dismayed, so
near it came.  Then Achilles drew his sword, and
rushed on Æneas, and Æneas caught up a great
stone to cast at him.  But it was not the will of
the gods that Æneas should perish, seeing that he
and his sons after him should rule over the men
of Troy in the ages to come.  Therefore Poseidon
lifted him up, and bore him over the ranks of men
to the left of the battle, but first he drew the
spear out of the shield, and laid it at the feet of
Achilles.  Much the hero marvelled to see it,
crying: "This is a great wonder that I behold with
mine eyes.  For I see my spear before me, but the
man whom I sought to slay I see not.  Of a
truth Æneas spake truth, saying that he was dear
to the immortal gods."
</p>

<p>
Then he rushed into the battle, slaying as he
went.  And Hector would have met him, but
Apollo stood by him, and said, "Fight not with
Achilles, lest he slay thee."  Therefore he went
back among the men of Troy.  Many did Achilles
slay, and among them Polydorus, son of Priam,
who, because he was the youngest and very dear,
his father suffered not to go to the battle.  Yet
he went, in his folly, and being very swift of foot,
he trusted in his speed, running through the
foremost of the fighters.  But as he ran, Achilles
smote him, and wounded him to the death.  When
Hector saw it, he could not bear any more to stand
apart.  Therefore he rushed at Achilles, and
Achilles rejoiced to see him, saying, "This is the
man who slew my comrade."  And to Hector he
cried, "Come hither, and taste of death."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Pol-y-do'-rus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And Hector made answer: "Son of Peleus,
seek not to make me afraid with words.  For
though I be weaker than thou, yet victory lieth
on the knees of the gods, and I, too, bear a
spear."
</p>

<p>
Then he cast his spear; but Athene turned it
aside with her breath, and laid it again at his feet.
And when Achilles leapt upon Hector with a
shout, Apollo snatched him away.  Three times
did Achilles leap upon him, and three times he
struck only the mist.  But the fourth time he
cried with a terrible voice, "Dog, thou hast
escaped from death, Apollo helping thee; but I
shall meet thee again, and make an end of thee."
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles turned to the others, and slew
multitudes of them, so that they fled, some across
the plain, and some to the river, the eddying
Xanthus.  And these leapt into the water as locusts
leap into a river when a fire which men light
drives them from the fields.  And all the river
was full of horses and men.  Then Achilles leapt
into the stream, leaving his spear on the bank,
resting on the tamarisk trees.  Only his sword
had he, and with this he slew many; and they
were as fishes which fly from some great dolphin
in the sea.  And when Achilles was weary of
slaying, he took twelve alive, whom he would slay
on the tomb of Patroclus.
</p>

<p>
Then there met him Asteropæus, who was the
grandson of a river-god Axius.  And Achilles
wondered to see him, and said, "Who art thou,
that standest against me?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
As-ter-o-pæ'-us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ax'-i-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And he said, "I am the grandson of the river-god
Axius, fairest of all the streams on the earth."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake he cast two spears, one with each
hand, for he could use either alike; and the one
struck the shield, nor pierced it through, for the
gold stayed it, and the other grazed the right hand
so that the blood spurted forth.  Then did Achilles
cast his spear, but missed his aim, and the
great spear stood fast in the bank.  And thrice
Asteropæus strove to draw it forth.  Thrice he
strove in vain, and the fourth time he strove to
break the spear.  But as he strove Achilles smote
him so that he died.  Yet had he some glory, for
he had wounded the great Achilles.

THE BATTLE OF THE GODS
</h3>

<p>
When the River saw that Asteropæus was
dead, he took upon him the shape of a man, and
spake to Achilles, saying: "Truly, Achilles, thou
excellest all other men in might and deeds of
blood, for the gods themselves protect thee.  It
may be that Zeus hath given thee to slay all the
sons of Troy; nevertheless, depart from me and
work thy will upon the plain; for my stream
is choked with the multitude of corpses, nor can I
pass to the sea.  Do thou, therefore, cease from
troubling me."
</p>

<p>
To him Achilles made answer: "This shall be
as thou wilt, O Scamander.  But the Trojans I
will not cease from slaying till I have driven them
into their city and have made trial of Hector,
whether I shall vanquish him or he shall vanquish
me."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake he sped on, pursuing the Trojans.
Then the River cried to Apollo: "Little
thou doest the will of thy father, thou of the
Silver Bow, who bade thee stand by the men of
Troy and help them till darkness should cover the
land."  And he rushed on with a great wave,
stirring together all his streams.  The dead bodies
he threw upon the shore, roaring as a bull roareth;
and them that lived he hid in the depth of his
eddies.  And all about Achilles rose up the flood,
beating full upon his shield, so that he could not
stand fast upon his feet.  Then Achilles laid hold
of a lime tree, fair and tall, that grew upon the
bank; but the tree brake therefrom with all its
roots, and tare down the bank, and lay across the
River, staying its flow, for it had many branches.
Thereupon Achilles leapt out of the water and
sped across the plain, being sore afraid.  But the
River ceased not from pursuing him, that he
might stay him from slaughter and save the sons
of Troy.  So far as a man may throw a spear, so
far did Achilles leap.  And still as he fled the
River pursued after him with a great roar.
</p>

<p>
And when Achilles would have stood against
the River, seeking to know whether indeed all the
gods were against him, then the great wave smote
upon his shoulders; and when he leapt into the
air, it bowed his knees beneath him and devoured
the ground from under his feet.  Then Achilles
looked up to heaven and groaned, crying out: "O
Zeus, will none of the gods pity me, and save me
from the River?  I care not what else may befall
me.  Truly my mother hath deceived me, saying
that I should perish under the walls of Troy by
the arrows of Apollo.  Surely it had been better
that Hector should slay me, for he is the bravest
of the men of Troy, but now I shall perish
miserably in the River, as some herdboy perisheth
whom a torrent sweepeth away in a storm."
</p>

<p>
So he spake; but Poseidon and Athene stood by
him, having taken upon them the shape of men,
and took him by the hand and strengthened him
with comforting words, for Poseidon spake,
saying: "Son of Peletis, tremble not, neither be
afraid.  It is not thy fate to be mastered by the
River.  He shall soon cease from troubling thee.
And do thou heed what we say.  Stay not thy
hands from the battle, till thou shalt have driven
all the sons of Troy that escape thee within the
walls of the city.  And when thou shalt have slain
Hector, go back to the ships; for this day is the
day of thy glory."
</p>

<p>
Then the two departed from him.  Now all the
plain was covered with water, wherein floated
much fair armour and many dead bodies.  But
Achilles went on even against the stream, nor
could the River hold him back; for Athene put
great might into his heart.  Yet did not Scamander
cease, from his wrath, but lifted his waves yet
higher, and cried aloud to Simois: "Dear brother,
let us two stay the fury of this man, or else of a
surety he will destroy the city of Priam.  Come
now, fill all thy streams and rouse thy torrents
against him, and lift up against him a mighty
wave with tree-trunks and stones, that we may
stay this wild man from his fighting.  Neither his
might, nor his beauty, nor his fair form shall profit
him, for they shall be covered with much mud;
and over him will I heap sand beyond all counting.
Neither shall the Greeks be able to gather
his bones together, with such a heap will I hide
them."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Si'-mo-is.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then he rushed again upon Achilles, swelling
high with foam and blood and dead bodies of men.
Very dark was the wave as it rose, and was like
to have overwhelmed the man, so that Hera
greatly feared for him, lest the River should
sweep him away.  And she cried to Hephæstus,
her son, saying: "Rouse thee, Haltfoot, my son!
Come, help us, and bring much fire with thee;
and I will call the west wind and the south wind
from the sea, with such a storm as shall consume
the sons of Troy, both them and their arms.  And
do thou burn the trees that are by the banks of
Xanthus, yea, and the River himself.  And let
him not turn thee from thy purpose by fury or by
craft; but burn till I shall bid thee cease."
</p>

<p>
Then Hephæstus lit a great fire.  First it
burned the dead bodies that lay upon the plain,
and it dried all the plain, as the north wind in the
autumn time dries a field, to the joy of him that
tills it.  After this it laid hold of the River.  The
lime tree and the willows and the tamarisks it
burned; also the plants that grew in the streams.
And the eels and the fishes were sore distressed,
twisting hither and thither in the water, being
troubled by the breath of Hephæstus.  So the
might of the River was subdued, and he cried
aloud: "O Hephæstus, no one of the gods can
match himself with thee.  Cease now from
consuming me; and Achilles may drive the men of
Troy from the city if he will.  What have I to do
with the strife and sorrow of men?"
</p>

<p>
And Queen Hera heard him, and called to
Hephæstus, saying: "Cease, my son; it doth not
beseem thee to work such damage to a god for the
sake of a mortal man."
</p>

<p>
So Hephæstus quenched his fire, and the River
flowed as he flowed before.
</p>

<p>
But among the other gods there arose a dreadful
strife, for they were divided, the one part against
the other.  With a great crash they came together,
and the broad earth resounded, and the heavens
rang as with the voice of a trumpet; and Zeus
heard it as he sat on Olympus, and was glad in
heart to see the gods join in battle.
</p>

<p>
First of all, Ares, the shield-piercer, rushed
against Athene, holding his spear in his hand, and
cried: "Why dost thou make the gods to strive
in battle, thou that art bold as a fly and shameless
as a dog?  Dost thou not remember how thou
didst set Diomed, the son of Tydeus, upon me to
wound me, and how thou didst take his spear in
thy hand, so that all might see it, and drive it
through my thigh?  Now will I repay thee for all
that thou hast done."
</p>

<p>
And he smote on the shield&mdash;the mighty shield
that not even the thunder of Zeus can break.
But Athene took up in her hand a great stone that
lay upon the plain.  Black it was and rough, and
very great, that men of old had set for a boundary
of the field.  With this she smote Ares on the
neck, that his knees failed beneath him.  He lay
along the ground, a hundred feet and more, and
Athene laughed when she saw him, and cried:
"Fool! hast thou not yet learned how much
stronger I am than thou, that thou matchest thy
might against me?  Lie there and suffer the
curses of thy mother; for she is wroth because
thou hast betrayed the Greeks and helpest the
men of Troy."
</p>

<p>
But Aphrodite took him by the hand, and would
have led him away; deep did he groan, and scarce
could he gather his spirit together.  And when
Hera saw it, she cried to Athene, saying: "See
now, how Aphrodite would lead Ares out of the
battle!  Pursue her now, and hinder her."
</p>

<p>
So Athene pursued after her, and smote her on
the breast with her heavy hand; and her knees
failed beneath her.  So these two lay upon the
earth, and Athene cried over them: "Now would
that all who help the sons of Troy were as brave
and strong as these two.  Long since had we
ceased from war and destroyed the fair city of
Troy."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
THE SLAYING OF HECTOR
</h3>

<p>
While these things were doing, Achilles ceased
not to pursue and slay the men of Troy, and
Priam stood on a tower of the wall and saw the
people.  Sore troubled was he, and he hastened
down to the gates and said to the keepers, "Keep
the gates open, that the people may enter in, for
they fly before Achilles."  So the keepers held
the gates open, and the people hastened in, wearied
with toil and thirst, and covered with dust, and
Achilles followed close upon them.  And that
hour would the Greeks have taken the city of
Troy, but that Apollo saved it.  For he put
courage into the heart of Agenor, standing also
by him, that he should not be slain.  And Agenor
thought within himself:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
A-ge'-nor.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Shall I flee with these others?  Nay, for Achilles
will take me and slay me, and I shall die as a
coward dies.  Or shall I flee across the plain to
Ida, and hide me in the thickets, and come back
at nightfall to the city?  Yet should he see me he
will overtake me and smite me, so swift of foot is
lie and strong.  But what if I stand to meet him
before the gates?  He, too, is a mortal man, and
his flesh may be pierced by the spear."
</p>

<p>
Wherefore he stood till Achilles should come
near.  And when he came he cast his spear, striking
the leg below the knee, but the greave turned
off the spear, so strong was it.  And when Achilles
would have slain him, lo! Apollo lifted him
up and set him within the city.  And that the
men of Troy might have time to enter, he took
upon him Agenor's shape.  And the false Agenor
fled, and Achilles pursued.  But meanwhile the
men of Troy flocked into the city, nor did they
stay to ask who was safe and who was dead, in
such haste and fear did they flee.  Only Hector
remained outside the walls, standing in front of
the great Scæan gates.  But all the while Achilles
was fiercely pursuing the false Agenor, till at last
Apollo turned and spake to him:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why dost thou pursue me, swift-footed Achilles?
Hast thou not yet found out that I am a
god, and that all thy fury is in vain?  And now
all the sons of Troy are safe in their city, and
thou art here, far out of the way, seeking to slay
me, who cannot die."
</p>

<p>
In great wrath Achilles answered him: "Thou
hast done me wrong in so drawing me away from
the wall, great archer, most mischief-loving of all
the gods that are.  Had it not been for this, many
a Trojan more had bitten the ground.  Thou hast
robbed me of great glory, and saved thy favourites.
O that I had the power to take vengeance on thee!
Thou wouldst have paid dearly for thy cheat!"
</p>

<p>
Then he turned and rushed towards the city,
swift as a race-horse whirls a chariot across the
plain.  Old Priam spied him from the walls, with
his glittering armour, bright as that brightest of
the stars&mdash;men call it Orion's dog&mdash;which shines
at vintage-time.  And the old man groaned aloud
when he saw him, and stretching out his hands,
cried to his son Hector, who stood before the gates,
eager to do battle with this dread warrior:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
O-ri'-on.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Wait not for this man, dear son, wait not for
him, lest thou die beneath his hand, for indeed he
is stronger than thou.  Come within the walls,
dear child; come to save the sons and daughters
of Troy; come in pity for me, thy father, for
whom, in my old age, an evil fate is in store, to
see sons slain with the sword, and daughters
carried into captivity, and babes dashed upon the
ground."
</p>

<p>
And his mother besought him also, but in vain.
He was still minded to abide the coming of
Achilles.  Just as in the mountains a great snake
at its hole abides the coming of a man; fierce
glare its eyes, and it coils its tail about its hole:
so Hector waited for Achilles.
</p>

<p>
And Achilles came near, brandishing over his
right shoulder his great spear, and the flash of his
arms was as the flame of fire, or as the rising sun.
And Hector trembled when he saw him, nor dared
to abide his coming.  Fast he fled from the gates,
and fast Achilles pursued him, as a hawk, fastest
of all the birds of the air, pursues a dove upon the
mountains.  Past the watch-tower they ran, past
the wind-blown fig tree, along the wagon-road
which went about the walls, and they came to the
fair-flowing fountain where from two springs rises
the stream of eddying Scamander.
</p>

<p>
Past these springs they ran, one fleeing, the
other pursuing; brave was he that fled, braver he
that pursued; it was no sheep for sacrifice or
shield of ox-hide for which they ran, but for the
life of Hector, the tamer of horses.  Thrice they
ran round the city, and all the gods looked on.
</p>

<p>
And Zeus said: "This is a piteous sight that I
behold.  My heart is grieved for Hector&mdash;Hector,
who has ever worshipped me with sacrifice;
and now the great Achilles is pursuing him round
the city of Priam.  Come, ye gods, let us take
counsel together.  Shall we save him from death,
or let him fall beneath the hand of Achilles?"
</p>

<p>
Then Athene said: "What is this that thou
sayest, great sire?&mdash;to rescue a man whom fate
has appointed to die?  Do it, if it be thy will;
but we, the other gods, approve it not."
</p>

<p>
Zeus answered her: "My heart is loath; yet I
would do thee pleasure.  Be it as thou wilt."
</p>

<p>
Then Athene came down in haste from the top
of Olympus, and still Hector fled and Achilles
pursued, just as a dog pursues a fawn upon the
hills.  And ever Hector made for the gates, or to
get shelter beneath the towers, so that those that
stood upon them might defend him with their
spears; and ever Achilles would get before him,
and drive him towards the plain.  So they ran,
one making for the city, and the other driving him
to the plain.
</p>

<p>
Now Achilles had beckoned to the Greeks that
no man should throw his spear at Hector, lest,
perchance, he should be robbed of his glory.  And
when the two came in their running for the fourth
time to the springs of Scamander, Zeus held out
the great balance of doom, and in one scale he put
the fate of Achilles, and in the other the fate of
Hector; and lo! the scale of Hector sank down to
the realms of death, and Apollo left him.
</p>

<p>
Then Athene lighted down from the air close to
Achilles and said: "This, great Achilles, is our
day of glory, for we shall slay Hector, mighty
warrior though he be.  For it is his doom to die,
and not Apollo's self shall save him.  But stand
thou still and take breath, and I will give this
man heart to meet thee in battle."
</p>

<p>
So Achilles stood leaning upon his spear.  And
Athene took the shape of Deiphobus, and came
near to Hector and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
De-iph'-o-bus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Achilles presses thee hard, my brother, pursuing
thee thus round the city of Priam.  Come, let
us make a stand and encounter him."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector answered him, "Deiphobus, I
always loved thee best of all my brothers; but
now I love thee yet more, for thou alone, while
all others remained within, hast ventured forth
to stand by my side."
</p>

<p>
But the false Deiphobus said: "Much did
father and mother and all my comrades beseech
me to remain.  But my heart was sore troubled
for thee, and I could not stay.  But let us stand
and fight this man, and see whether he shall carry
our spoil to the ships, or we shall slay him
here."
</p>

<p>
Then the two chiefs came near to each other,
and Hector with the waving plume spake first,
and said: "Thrice, great Achilles, hast thou
pursued me round the walls of Troy, and I dared not
stand up against thee; but now I fear thee no
more.  Only let us make this covenant between
us: if Zeus give me the victory, I will do no
dishonour to thy body; thy arms and armour will I
take, and give back thy body to the Greeks; and
do thou promise to do likewise."
</p>

<p>
But Achilles scowled at him and said: "Hector,
talk not of covenants to me.  Men and lions make
no oaths between each other, neither is there any
agreement between wolves and sheep.  So there
shall be no covenant between me and thee.  One
of us two shall fall; and now is the time for thee
to show thyself a warrior, for of a truth Athene
will slay thee by my spear, and thou shalt pay the
penalty for all my comrades whom thou hast slain."
</p>

<p>
Then he threw the mighty spear, but Hector
saw it coming and avoided it, crouching on the
ground, so that the mighty spear flew above his
head and fixed itself in the earth.  But Athene
snatched it from the ground and gave it back to
Achilles, Hector not perceiving.
</p>

<p>
Then Hector spake to Achilles: "Thou hast
missed thy aim, great Achilles.  Now look out
for my spear.  Would that it might bury itself in so
thy flesh!  The battle would be easier for the
men of Troy were thou only out of the way."
</p>

<p>
And as he spake he threw his long-shafted
spear.  True aim he took, for the spear struck the
very middle of Achilles' shield.  It struck, but
pierced it not, but bounded far away, for the
shield was not of mortal make.  And Hector
stood dismayed, for he had not another spear, and
when he called to Deiphobus that he should give
him another, lo! Deiphobus was gone.  Then
Hector knew that his end was come, and he said
to himself: "Now have the gods called me to my
doom.  I thought that Deiphobus was near; but
he is within the walls, and the help which he
promised me was but a cheat with which Athene
cheated me.  Zeus and Apollo are with me no
more; but if I must die, let me at least die in
such a deed as men of after time may hear of."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and drew the mighty sword that
hung by his side: then as an eagle rushes through
the clouds to pounce on a lamb, he rushed on the
great Achilles.  But he dealt never a blow; for
Achilles charged to meet him, his shield before his
breast, his helmet bent forward as he ran, with the
long plumes streaming behind, and the gleam of
his spear-point was as the gleam of the evening
star, which is the fairest of all the stars in heaven.
One moment he thought where he should drive it
home, for the armour which Hector had won from
Patroclus guarded him well; but one spot there
was, where by the collar-bone the neck joins the
shoulder (and nowhere is the stroke of sword or
spear more deadly).  There he drave in the spear,
and the point stood out behind the neck, and
Hector fell in the dust.
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles cried aloud: "Hector, thou
thoughtest in the day when thou didst spoil
Patroclus of his arms that thou wouldst be safe from
vengeance.  And lo! thou art fallen before me,
and now the dogs and vultures shall devour thee,
but to him all the Greeks shall give due burial."
</p>

<p>
But Hector, growing faint, spake to him:
"Nay, great Achilles, by thy life, and by thy
knees, and by thy parents dear, I pray thee, let
not the dogs of the Greeks devour me.  Take
rather the ransom, gold and bronze, that my father
and mother shall pay thee, and let the sons and
daughters of Troy give me burial rites."
</p>

<p>
But Achilles scowled at him, and cried: "Dog,
seek not to entreat me!  I could mince that flesh
of thine and devour it raw, such grief hast thou
wrought me.  Surely the dogs shall devour thee,
nor shall any man hinder.  No ransom, though it
were ten times told, should buy thee back; no, not
though Priam should offer thy weight in gold."
</p>

<p>
Then Hector, who was now at the point to die,
spake to him: "I know thee well, what manner
of man thou art, that the heart in thy breast is
iron only.  Only beware lest some vengeance
from the gods come upon thee in the day when
Paris and Apollo shall slay thee, for all thy valour,
by the Scæan gates."
</p>

<p>
So speaking, he died.  But Achilles said, "Die,
hound; but my fate I meet when Zeus and the
other gods decree."
</p>

<p>
Then he drew his spear out of the corpse, and
stripped off the arms; and all the Greeks came
about the dead man, marvelling at his stature and
beauty, and no man came but wounded the dead
corpse.  And one would say to another, "Surely
this Hector is less dreadful now than in the day
when he would burn our ships with fire."
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles devised a ruthless thing in his
heart.  He pierced the ankle-bones of Hector, and
so bound the body with thongs of ox-hide to the
chariot, letting the head drag behind, the head that
once was so fair, and now was so disfigured in the
dust.  So he dragged Hector to the ships.  And
Priam saw him from the walls, and scarce could his
sons keep him back, but that he should go forth and
beg the body of his dear son from him who had
slain him.  And Hecuba, his mother, also bewailed
him, but Andromache knew not as yet of what
had befallen.  For she sat in her dwelling, weaving
a great purple mantle broidered with flowers.
And she bade her maidens make ready a bath for
Hector, when he should come back from the battle,
nor knew that he should never need it more.  But
the voice of wailing from the town came to her,
and she rose up hastily in great fear, and dropped
the shuttle from her hand, and called to her
maidens:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, ye maidens, that I may see
what has befallen, for I heard the voice of Queen
Hecuba, and I fear me much that some evil has
come to the children of Priam.  For it may be
that Achilles has run between Hector and the
city, and is pursuing him to the plain, for never
will Hector abide with the army, but will fight in
the front, so bold is he."
</p>

<p>
Then she hasted through the city like as she
were mad.  And when she came to the wall, she
stood and looked; and lo! the horses of Achilles
were dragging Hector to the ships.  Then did
darkness come on her, and she fell back fainting.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
THE BURNING OF PATROCLUS
</h3>

<p>
While the Trojans mourned for Hector in the
city, the Greeks went back to the camp.  All the
others were scattered, each to his own ship, but
Achilles spake to the Myrmidons, saying, "Loose
not your horses from the yoke, but let us do
honour to Patroclus, driving our chariots round the
dead, and making lamentation the while."
</p>

<p>
Then the Myrmidons did as he had bidden them;
thrice round the dead they drave their chariots,
and made lamentation; and Achilles led the
mourning.  Also he laid the body of Hector in
the dust beside the dead.  After that he made a
funeral feast for his people.  He himself was
brought by the chiefs, much against his will, to
King Agamemnon, who had made a great feast for
the leaders of the Greeks.  But when the heralds
heated water in a caldron, and would have had
him wash off the blood, he refused, saying; "Nay;
water shall not come nigh me till I have laid
Patroclus on the fire, and heaped a mound over him.
Now let us eat our meal, though it be in sorrow;
to-morrow we will pay due honour to the dead."
</p>

<p>
So they ate and drank; and when they had had
enough, the others lay down to sleep, each in his
own tent, but Achilles lay groaning heavily amidst
the Myrmidons in an open place by the sea.
</p>

<p>
The next day they made a great pile of wood,
and laid the dead man thereon.  Nine dogs had
the Prince, and Achilles slew two of them on the
pile, and four horses he slew, and also the twelve
youths of Troy whom he had taken at the river.
Then he set fire to the pile, saying: "Hear,
Patroclus; twelve of the sons of Troy doth the fire
devour with thee; but Hector will I give to the
dogs."
</p>

<p>
And when the burning was well-nigh ended,
Achilles spake, saying: "Quench ye the fire that
yet remains with wine, and gather the bones of
Patroclus together where they lie apart in the
midst of the pile, and put them in an urn of gold
against the day of my death.  And make over
them a tomb not over large; but when I am dead
also, then shall ye that are left make it higher, as
is meet."
</p>

<p>
And when all these things were ended, Achilles,
willing to do all honour to the dead man, would
have games, wherein the chiefs should contend one
with the other.  So, having called the people
together, he brought forth out of his ships many
things that should be for prizes,&mdash;caldrons, kettles
of bronze, and horses and mules, and fair
women-slaves, and iron.
</p>

<p>
First, he would have a contest of chariots and
horses, for which he set forth prizes: for the first,
a woman-slave, skilled in all the works of the
loom, and with her a kettle of bronze; and for the
second, a mare of six years old; and for the third,
a kettle of bronze, fair and new; and for the
fourth, two talents of gold; and for the fifth, a
double cup.  Then he stood up in the midst, and
spake: "Ye men of Greece, behold these prizes,
which I have set in the midst for a race of chariots.
Now know ye that if we were doing honour to
another than Patroclus, I myself should carry the
first prize to my tent, for there are not in the
camp horses such as mine; and, indeed, they are
not of mortal breed, but Poseidon gave them to
Peleus, my father.  But from this race I stand
apart, and they also; for he that drave them is
dead, whom they loved; therefore they stand
grieving sore, and their manes droop to the ground."  Then
stood up five chiefs; first of all, Eumelus,
and next to him Diomed, having horses of Troy,
which he took from Æneas; and third, Menelaus,
driving his horse Whitefoot, and a mare,
Flash-of-Fire.  Fourth came Antilochus, son of Nestor,
and after him Meriones.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Eu-me'-lus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After this they drew lots for their places.  And
the first lot fell to Antilochus, and after him came
Eumelus, and Menelaus, and Meriones, and Diomed,
in this order.  Then Achilles marked the
course, making old Phœnix the judge.  After this
the race began, and the men lifted their whips and
smote their horses, and shouted also.  And the
dust rose up beneath the horses' breasts, and their
manes were blown by the wind, and the chariots
were seen now low upon the earth and now high
in the air.  But when they were come near to the
end of the course at the turning-point, it might
be seen which steeds were the better.  For the
horses of Eumelus were foremost, and next to
these the horses of King Diomed, very close, so
that they seemed about to step upon the chariot
that was before them, and the back and broad
shoulders of Eumelus were hot with their breath.
And Diomed would now have passed him, or been
equal in the race, but Apollo grudged him the
victory,&mdash;for the god loved him not,&mdash;and struck
the whip out of his hand.  Very wroth was Diomed,
and his eyes were filled with tears, that his
horses should thus lack control.  But Athene
saw the thing and had pity on him, and gave
him back the whip, and put strength into his
horses.  Also she went near to Eumelus, and
brake the yoke of his chariot, so that the pole
smote upon the ground, and the man himself was
thrown down, having his elbows and mouth and
nostrils sorely bruised, and a wound on his
forehead over the eyebrows.  Then did Diomed take
the first place with his chariot, and next to him
came Menelaus.  But Antilochus cried to his
horses, saying: "Now speed ye as best ye can.  I
bid you not strive with the horses of King
Diomed, for Athene giveth them swiftness and
strength; but the horses of Menelaus ye can
overtake.  It were a shame to you that Flame-of-Fire,
being a mare, should surpass you."
</p>

<p>
And the horses feared the fury of the Prince,
and leapt forward.  Now Antilochus had spied a
narrow place in the way, where it had been broken
by the floods in the winter; and as Menelaus
drove his chariot thereby, Antilochus, turning a
little out of the way, sought to pass at the same
time.  Now there was not space sufficient for two
chariots, and Menelaus feared, and cried: "Why
drivest thou so madly, Antilochus?  Stay awhile,
and thou canst pass me if thou wilt, where the
way is broader; but now thou wilt hurt thy
chariot and mine."  But Antilochus drave the
more furiously, making as though he heard not.
And for the space of a quoit's throw the chariots
were abreast, but then Menelaus held back, fearing
lest they should clash together.  But he cried
to Antilochus: "Was there ever man so
evil-minded as thou?  Yet shalt thou not win this
prize unless thou shalt forswear thyself that thou
hast dealt fairly."  And to his horses cried:
"Speed ye!  Stand not still; ye shall overtake
them, for they will grow weary before you."
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the Greeks sat waiting till the
chariots should come back.
</p>

<p>
Then came in Diomed first of all, and leapt from
the chariot; and next to him Antilochus, having
surpassed Menelaus by craft and not by speed;
nor, indeed, was Menelaus far behind, being as
near to him as a chariot is near to the horse which
draweth it, so swift was the mare Flame-of-Fire,
for at the first he had been a whole quoit's throw
behind.  But Meriones was vanquished by the
flight of a spear, for his horses were the slowest,
and he himself less skilled to drive.  Last of all
came Eumelus, drawing his chariot, and driving
his horses before him.  And Achilles pitied him
and said: "The most skilful cometh last.  Surely
he shall have the second prize."
</p>

<p>
And the Greeks gave consent; but Antilochus
cried aloud: "Wilt thou take away this prize from
me because his chariot was broken?  Had he
prayed to the gods, this had not happened.  But
if thou pitiest him, give him somewhat of thine
own.  As for this prize, no man taketh it from
me but by arms."
</p>

<p>
And Achilles laughed and said: "'Tis well
said, Antilochus.  I will give him of mine own,
even a breastplate which Asteropæus wore."
</p>

<p>
Then stood up Menelaus, in great wrath, and
said: "What is this that thou hast done,
Antilochus?  For thou hast shamed me and my horses,
putting thine own in front, which are, of a truth,
much worse than they.  Judge, therefore, between
us, ye chiefs of the Greeks.  And thou, Antilochus,
stand before thy chariot and thy horses, as
the custom is, holding in one hand thy whip, and
laying the other hand on thine horses, and swear
by Poseidon that thou didst not hinder my chariot
by fraud."
</p>

<p>
To him Antilochus made reply: "Bear with
me, Menelaus, for I am younger than thou, and
thou knowest how young men go astray, for their
judgment is hasty and their wit small.  And as
for the mare, I give it thee, and aught else that
thou desirest, rather than that I should be at strife
with thee or sin against the gods."
</p>

<p>
And the soul of Menelaus was glad, as the corn
is glad when the dew falleth upon it; and he said:
"This is well said, son of Nestor.  And now&mdash;for
thy father and thy brother have borne much
for my sake&mdash;I give thee this mare."
</p>

<p>
And he himself took the kettle of bronze, and
the fourth prize Meriones had; but the double cup
Achilles gave to old Nestor, saying: "Take this
to be a memorial of the burial of Patroclus, whom
thou wilt not see any more.  For I know that old
age hinders thee, that thou canst not contend in
wrestling or boxing with the rest."
</p>

<p>
After this Achilles set forth two prizes for
boxers: for the conqueror a mule, and for him that
should be vanquished a cup with two mouths.
Then stood up Epeius and spake: "Who desireth
to take this cup? for the mule no man but I shall
have.  In battle I am weak&mdash;for what man can
do all things?&mdash;but whosoever shall stand against
me to-day, verily, I will tear his flesh and break
his bones, so that his friends had best be at hand
to carry him away."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
E-pei'-us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then there rose up against him Euryalus.
King Diomed stood by him, wishing much that he
might prevail, and brought him his girdle that he
might gird himself, and gave him the great gloves
of bull's hide.  Then the two stood together in
the midst.  Many blows did they deal to each
other, so that the noise was dreadful to hear, and
the sweat ran down from them.  But after awhile
Epeius sprang forward and smote Euryalus on the
jaw, even through his guard, and Euryalus could
not stand against him; but even as a fish is dashed
by the north wind against the shore, so was he
dashed to the earth.  But Epeius raised him up,
and his companions led him away, sorely wounded
and amazed.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Eu-ry'-a-lus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After this Achilles would have a match of
wrestling, saying that the conqueror should have
a great kettle of bronze, of twelve oxen's worth,
and the vanquished a woman-slave, skilful at the
loom, worth four oxen.  Then stood up Ajax the
Greater and Ulysses, and took hold of one another
with their hands, and strove together for the
mastery.  But after a while, when neither could
prevail, and the people were weary with looking,
Ajax spake, saying: "Come, Ulysses; thou shalt
lift me from the ground if thou canst, and I thee.
So shall we finish this matter."  Then Ajax laid
hold of Ulysses to lift him; and this he had done,
but Ulysses used craft, as was his wont, and put
forth his leg and smote Ajax on the sinew behind
the knee, so that he fell, and Ulysses also above
him.  Then Ulysses would have lifted Ajax from
the ground; a little space he moved him, but
lifted him not, and his knee yielded beneath him,
and they fell to the ground, both of them.  But
when they would have striven the third time,
Achilles hindered them, saying: "Hold! it is
enough.  Ye are conquerors both, and your prizes
shall be equal."
</p>

<p>
Next to this was a trial of racers on foot, in
which three contended, Ajax the Less, and Ulysses,
and Antilochus.  In a short space Ajax the Less
was foremost, with Ulysses close upon him, close
as is the shuttle to the breast of a woman who
stands at the loom and weaves.  Hard behind him
he ran, treading in his steps before the dust could
rise from them.  And when they were now drawing
to the end of the course Ulysses prayed to
Athene that she should help him, and Athene
heard him, and made his knees and feet right
nimble, and even at the very end she caused that
Ajax slipped in the filth where certain oxen had
been slain, so that his mouth and nostrils were
filled with it.  So Ulysses gained the mixing-bowl;
but Ajax stood and spat the filth from his
mouth, and laid his hand on the head of the ox,
and cried, "Surely the goddess caused my feet to
slip, for she ever standeth by Ulysses, and helpeth
him as a mother helpeth a child."
</p>

<p>
So he spake, and all men laughed to hear him;
and last of all came Antilochus, taking the third
prize.  And he said: "Ye know well, my friends,
that the immortal gods ever help the aged.  As
for Ajax, he is but a little older than I, but Ulysses
is of another generation.  Yet is his verily a
green old age; hardly may any of the Greeks
strive with him, but only Achilles himself."
</p>

<p>
So the Games of Patroclus were ended; and
the people were scattered to the ships, and sat
down to eat and drink; and afterwards they slept.
But Achilles slept not, for he remembered his dear
Patroclus, and all that the two had done and
endured together, journeying over sea and land,
and standing against the enemy in the day of
battle.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
THE RANSOMING OF HECTOR
</h3>

<p>
When the burial of Patroclus was ended, the
gods held council about Hector, for Achilles did
despite to the body of Hector, dragging it about
the tomb of his friend, but the gods had pity on
the dead man, because in his life he had ever
honoured them.
</p>

<p>
Then did Zeus send for Thetis, and when she
was come to Olympus, he said: "Get thee to the
camp, and bid thy son give up Hector for ransom,
for I am wroth with him because he doth despite
to the dead."
</p>

<p>
So Thetis went to Achilles, and found him
weeping softly for his dead friend, for the strength
of his sorrow was now spent, and she said to him:
"It is the will of the gods that thou give up the
body of Hector, and take in exchange the ransom
of gold and precious things which his father will
give thee for him."
</p>

<p>
And her son answered, "Be it so, if the gods
will have it."
</p>

<p>
Then Zeus sent Iris, who was his messenger, to
King Priam, where he sat with his face wrapped
in his mantle, and his sons weeping about him, and
his daughters wailing through the chambers of his
palace.
</p>

<p>
Then Iris spake: "Be of good cheer, Priam,
Zeus has sent me to thee.  Go, taking with thee
such gifts as may best please the heart of Achilles,
and bring back the body of thy dear son Hector.
Go without fear of death or harm, and go alone.
Only let an aged herald be with thee, to help
thee when thou bringest back the body of the
dead."
</p>

<p>
Then Priam rose with joy, and bade his sons
bring forth his chariot; but first he went to his
chamber, and called to Hecuba, his wife, and told
her of his purpose, nor heeded when she sought to
turn him from it, but said: "Seek not to hold me
back, nor be a bird of evil omen in my house.  If
any prophet or seer had bidden me do this thing,
I should have held it a deceit; but now have I
heard the very voice of the messenger of Zeus.
Wherefore, I shall go.  And if I die, what care I?
Let Achilles slay me, if only I embrace once more
the body of my son."
</p>

<p>
Then he bade put into a wagon shawls and
mantles that had never been washed, and rugs,
and cloaks, and tunics, twelve of each, and ten
talents of gold, and two bright three-footed
caldrons, and four basins, and a cup of passing
beauty which the Thracians had given him.  The
old man spared nothing that he had, if only he
might buy back his son.  None of the Trojans
would he suffer to come near him.  "Begone,"
he cried, "ye cowards!  Have ye nothing to wail
for at home, that ye come to wail with me?
Surely, an easy prey will ye be to the Greeks, now
that Hector is dead."
</p>

<p>
Then the old man mounted his chariot in haste,
and drove forth from the palace.  Before him the
mules drew the four-wheeled wagon, and these
the herald Idæus guided.  But his chariot the old
King drove himself.  And all his kinsfolk went
with him, weeping as for one who was going to
his death.  But when they came down from the
city to the plain, Priam and the herald went
towards the ships of the Greeks, but all the
others returned to Troy.
</p>

<p>
But Zeus saw him depart, and said to Hermes:
"Hermes, go guide King Priam to the ships of
the Greeks, so that no man see him before he
comes to the tents of Achilles."
</p>

<p>
Then Hermes fastened on his feet the fair
sandals of gold with which he flies, fast as the
wind, over sea and land, and in his hand he took
the rod with which he opens and closes, as he
wills, the eyes of men.  And he flew down and
lighted on the plain of Troy, taking on him the
likeness of a fair youth.
</p>

<p>
But when they had driven past the great Tomb
of Ilus, they stopped the horses and the mules, to
let them drink of the river.  And darkness came
over the land; and then the herald spied Hermes,
and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
Her'-mes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Consider, my lord, what we shall do.  I see a
man, and I am sore afraid lest he slay us.  Shall
we flee on the chariot, or shall we go near and
entreat him, that he may have pity upon us?"
</p>

<p>
Then the old man was sore troubled, and his
hair stood up with fear.  But Hermes came near
and took him by the hand and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Whither goest thou, old man, with thy horses
and mules through the darkness?  Hast thou no
fear of these fierce Greeks, who are close at hand?
If any one should see thee with all this wealth,
what then?  And thou art not young, nor is thy
attendant young, that ye should defend yourselves
against an enemy.  But I will not harm thee, nor
suffer any other, for thou art like my own dear father."
</p>

<p>
"It is well, my son," said the old man.  "Surely
one of the blessed gods is with me, in causing me
to meet such an one as thou, so fair and so wise.
Happy the parents of such a son!"
</p>

<p>
And Hermes said: "Come, tell me true, old
man.  Are you sending away all these treasures
that they may be kept safe for you far away? or
are all the men of Troy leaving the city, seeing
now that Hector, who was their bravest warrior,
is dead?"
</p>

<p>
Then Priam answered, "Who art thou, my son,
and what thy race, that thou speakest so truly
about my hapless son?"
</p>

<p>
"Often," said Hermes, "have I seen Hector in
the battle, both at other times, and when he drove
the Greeks before him at the ships.  We, indeed,
stood and watched and marvelled at him, for
Achilles would not suffer us to fight, being wroth
with King Agamemnon.  Now I am a follower of
Achilles, coming from Greece in the same ship
with him."
</p>

<p>
Then said Priam, "If thou art an attendant of
Achilles, tell me true, is my son yet by the ships,
or have the dogs devoured him?"
</p>

<p>
And Hermes answered: "Nor dogs nor vultures
have devoured him.  Still he lies by the
ships of Achilles; and though this is the twelfth
day since he was slain, no decay has touched
him.  Nay, though Achilles drags him round the
tomb of his dear Patroclus, yet even so does no
unseemliness come to him.  All fresh he lies, and
the blood is washed from him, and all his wounds
are closed&mdash;and many spear-points pierced him.
The blessed gods love him well, dead man though
he be."
</p>

<p>
This King Priam was well pleased to hear.  "It
is well," he said, "for a man to honour the gods;
for, indeed, as my son never forgot the dwellers
on Olympus, so have they not forgotten him, even
in death.  But do thou take this fair cup, and do
kindness to him, and lead me to the tent of Achilles."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," answered Hermes; "thou speakest this
in vain.  No gift would I take from thy hand
unknown to Achilles; for I honour him much, and
fear to rob him, lest some evil happen to me
afterwards.  But thee I will guide to Argos itself, if
thou wilt, whether by land or sea, and no one shall
blame my guiding."
</p>

<p>
Then he leapt into the chariot of the King and
caught the reins in his hand, and gave the horses
and the mules a strength that was not their own.
And when they came to the ditch and the trench
that guarded the ships, lo! the guards were busy
with their meal; but Hermes made sleep descend
upon them, and opened the gates, and brought in
Priam with his treasures.  And when they came
to the tent of Achilles, Hermes lighted down from
the chariot and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Lo!  I am Hermes, whom my father Zeus hath
sent to be thy guide.  And now I shall depart,
for I would not that Achilles should see me.  But
go thou in, and clasp his knees, and beseech him
by his father, and his mother, and his child.  So
shalt thou move his heart with pity."
</p>

<p>
So Hermes departed to Olympus, and King
Priam leapt down from the chariot, leaving the
herald to care for the horses and the mules, and
went to the tent.  There he found Achilles sitting;
his comrades sat apart, but two waited on
him, for he had but newly ended his meal, and the
table was yet at his hand.  But no man saw King
Priam till he was close to Achilles, and caught hit
knees and kissed his hands, the dreadful, murderous
hands that had slain so many of his sons, and
Achilles wondered to see King Priam, and his
comrades wondered, looking one at another.  Then
King Priam spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Think of thy father, godlike Achilles, and
pity me.  He is old, as I am, and, it may be, his
neighbours trouble him, seeing that he has no
defender; yet so long as he knows that thou art
alive, it is well with him, for every day he hopes
to see his dear son returned from Troy.  But as
for me, I am altogether wretched.  Many a valiant
son I had,&mdash;nineteen born to me of one mother,&mdash;and
most of them are dead, and he that was the
best of all, who kept our city safe, he has been
slain by thee.  He it is whom I have come to
ransom.  Have pity on him and on me, thinking of
thy father.  Never, surely, was lot so sad as this,
to kiss the hands that slew a son."
</p>

<p>
And the words so stirred the heart if Achilles
that he wept, thinking now of Patroclus, and now
of his old father at home; and Priam wept, thinking
of his dead Hector.  But at last Achilles stood
up from his seat and raised King Priam, having
pity on his white hair and his white beard, and
spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How didst thou dare to come to the ships of
the Greeks, to the man who slew thy sons?  Surely,
thou must have a heart of iron.  But sit thou
down: let our sorrows rest in our hearts, for there
is no profit in lamentation.  It is the will of the
gods that men should suffer woe, but they are
themselves free from care."
</p>

<p>
But Priam answered: "Make me not to sit,
great Achilles, while Hector lies unhonoured.
Let me ransom him, and look upon him with my
eyes, and do thou take the gifts.  And the gods
grant thee to return safe to thy fatherland."
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles hastened from his tent, and two
comrades with him.  First they loosed the horses
from the chariot and the mules from the wagon;
then they brought in the herald Idæus, and took
the gifts.  Only they left of them two cloaks and
a tunic, wherein they might wrap the dead.  And
Achilles bade the women wash and anoint the
body, but apart from the tent, lest, perchance,
Priam should see his son and cry aloud.  But
when it was washed and anointed, Achilles himself
lifted it in his arms and put it on the litter,
and his comrades lifted the litter on the wagon.
</p>

<p>
And when all was finished, Achilles groaned
and cried to his dead friend, saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Be not wroth, Patroclus, if thou shouldst hear
in the unknown land that I have ransomed Hector
to his father: a noble ransom hath he paid me, and
of this, too, thou shalt have thy share, as is meet."
</p>

<p>
Then he went back to his tent, and set himself
down, over against Priam, and spake: "Thy
son is ransomed, old man, and to-morrow shalt
thou see him and take him back to Troy.  But
now let us eat.  To-morrow shalt thou weep for
Hector."
</p>

<p>
So they ate and drank.  And when the meal
was ended, Achilles sat and marvelled at King
Priam's noble look, and King Priam marvelled at
Achilles, so strong he was and fair.
</p>

<p>
Then Priam said: "Let me sleep, great Achilles.
I have not slept since my son fell by thy
hand.  Now I have eaten and drunk, and my eyes
are heavy."
</p>

<p>
So the comrades of Achilles made him a bed
outside, where no one might see him, should it
chance that any of the chiefs should come to the
tent of Achilles to take counsel, and should espy
him, and tell it to King Agamemnon.
</p>

<p>
But before he slept King Priam said: "If thou
art minded to let me bury Hector, let there be a
truce between my people and the Greeks.  For
nine days let us mourn for Hector, and on the
tenth will we bury him and feast the people, and on
the eleventh raise a great tomb above him, and on
the twelfth we will fight again, if fight we must."
</p>

<p>
And Achilles answered: "Be it so: I will stay
the war for so long."
</p>

<p>
But while Priam slept there came to him
Hermes, the messenger of Zeus, and said: "Sleepest
thou, Priam, among thy foes?  Achilles has
taken ransom for thy Hector; but thy sons that
are left would pay thrice as much for thee should
Agamemnon hear that thou wert among the
ships."
</p>

<p>
The old man heard and trembled, and roused
the herald, and the two yoked the horses and the
mules.  So they passed through the army, and no
man knew.  And when they came to the river,
Hermes departed to Olympus, and the morning
shone over all the earth.  Wailing and weeping,
they carried the body to the city.
</p>

<p>
And straightway there was not man or woman
left in the city.  They met the wagon when it was
close to the gates: his wife led the way, and his
mother and all the multitude followed.  And in
truth they would have kept it thus till evening,
weeping and wailing, but King Priam spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Let us pass; ye shall have enough of wailing
when we have taken him to his home."
</p>

<p>
So they took him to his home and laid him on
his bed.  And the minstrels lamented, and the
women wailed.
</p>

<p>
Then first of all came Andromache, his wife, and
cried:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O my husband, thou hast perished in thy
youth, and I am left in widowhood, and our child,
thy child and mine, is but an infant!  I fear me
he will not grow to manhood.  Ere that day
this city will fall, for thou art gone who wast its
defender."
</p>

<p>
Next spake Hecuba, his mother: "Dear wast
thou, my son, in life to the immortal gods, and
dear in death.  Achilles dragged thee about the
tomb of his dear Patroclus, but could not bring
him back, and now thou liest fresh and fair as
one whom the God of the silver bow has slain
with sudden stroke."
</p>

<p>
And last of all came Helen, and cried: "Many
a year has passed since I came to Troy&mdash;would
that I had died before!  And never have I heard
from thy lips one bitter word, and if others spake
harshly to me, thou wouldst check them with thy
gracious words.  Therefore I weep for thee; no
one is left to be my friend in all the broad streets
of Troy.  All shun and hate me now."
</p>

<p>
And all the people wailed reply.

<p>
Then Priam spake: "Go, my people, gather
wood for the burial, and fear not any ambush of
the Greeks, for Achilles promised that he would
stay the war until the twelfth day should come."
</p>

<p>
So for nine days the people gathered much
wood, and on the tenth they laid Hector upon the
pile, and lit fire beneath it.  And when it was
burnt they quenched the embers with wine.  Then
his brethren and comrades gathered together the
white bones, and laid them in a chest of gold;
and this they covered with purple robes and put it
in a great coffin, and laid upon it stones many and
great.  And over all they raised a mighty mound;
and all the while the watchers watched, lest the
Greeks should arise and slay them.  Last of all
was a great feast held in the palace of King Priam.
</p>

<p>
So they buried Hector.
</p>

<p>
After these things Achilles himself perished,
for he strove to break through the Scæan gate,
and there Paris wounded him to the death with
an arrow, but it was Apollo that guided the
archer's hand.
</p>

<p>
And when Troy still could not be taken, the
Greeks pretended to depart, burning their camp
and sailing away in their ships.  But they left
behind them a great horse of wood in which the
bravest of the chiefs hid themselves.  This the
men of Troy drew into their city; and at night,
when their thoughts were given to feasting, for
they thought that the war was ended, the chiefs
came out of the horse and threw open the gate, so
that the Greeks entered and took the city.
